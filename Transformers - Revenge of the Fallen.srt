00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:46,506
It's just that my low self-esteem's
at an all-time high.

160
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:48,481
Do you think
your little box of souveniers

161
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:49,968
is gonna keep me
from leaving you?

162
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:51,322
You really should
come with me,

163
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:53,135
they got cheap apartments
in campus.

164
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:55,064
Well,
that's not gonna happen

165
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:58,260
until I get my man child father
rushed out of prison,

166
00:11:58,296 --> 00:11:59,459
back on his feet.

167
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:00,686

168

the clutch covers?</i>

169
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:03,219
<i>Next to the cam shafts.</i>

170
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:05,605
I love it when you say cam shafts.
Whisper it to me.

171
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,773
Cam shafts.

174

Wait, hold on.
Wait, hold on a second.

175

we're not breaking up.</i>

176
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,610

177

Mikaela...

178
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:23,345

got stuck on my shirt.

181
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,291
Dad, we got a fire!

182

Ron, did you know
it was gonna be

184
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:15,850
- this hard?
- C-Can you just stop?

185
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:17,483
- Yeah, okay, I'll stop.
- Just wait...

186
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:19,003
- You carry this shit.
- I'll--I'll...

187
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:30,173
- Wow!
- You know what?

188
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,802
I don't wanna go
anywhere with you.

189
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:32,814
I don't wanna go
to France with you.

190
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,536
I don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

191
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:35,880
- Alright, fine.
- I'm just going back inside.

192
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,176
I'll call you from Paris.

193
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:50,449
What is all the racket?

194
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,475
- Whoa.
- Sam?

195
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,531
- Whoa, whoa.
- Dad...

196
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,761
- What was that?
- It's the whole kitchen!

197
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,298

is happening?

203

- Come here.

212
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,044
Listen, I need you
to take the Cube sliver.

213

- Hi.

217
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,252
- I have a bald spot.
- Oh.

218

Look, if we stay quiet,
they're gonna take care of everything.

224
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:37,944
Just consider this the official start
of a remodel, okay?

225
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,529
Fine. If the government's paying,
I want a pool...

226
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:41,747
- and a hot tub.
- Fine. Okay.

227
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:44,492

00:15:59,153 --> 00:15:59,916
Hey.

I'm not taking you
with me.

234

I wanna wait outside,
okay?

235
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,309
I wanted to tell you
about this earlier.

It's just that--
You know,

237

Here's the thing.

Freshmen aren't allowed
to have cars.

239
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:16,959
I know, and if it was up to me,
I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

240
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:18,360
Look, you're an Autobot.

241
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,050
You shouldn't be living
in my dad's garage.

242
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:21,633
I mean,
you're suffocating in here.

243
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,439
You deserve
better than this.

244
00:16:24,204 --> 00:16:25,422
This is hard enough, man,

245
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:27,283
don't make it harder.
Can you just look at me, please?

246
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:30,893
Come on, big guy.

247
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:34,667
Look, the guardian thing is done, okay?
You did your job.

250
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:40,129
I just want
to be normal, Bee.

251
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,573
That's why
I'm going to college.

252
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:43,641
I can't do that
with you.

253
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:47,491
It's not the last time
I'm gonna see you, you know, Bee.

254
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:50,687
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

255
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,393
But you'll always be
my first car.

Well, look.

262
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:15,339
So you think
you can make it

263
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:17,171
through those East Coast
winners without me?

264
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:18,946
You're like the best thing
that ever happened to me.

265

And?

266
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,415
- And I'll do anything for you.
- And?

267
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:27,339
- I think Sam's about to say the L word.
- Let's go, kiddo.

268
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,862
Nice timing, Dad.

269
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,176
I... adore you.

270
00:17:32,378 --> 00:17:34,290
That's not the word that
I wanna hear really now.

271
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:34,941
What are you
talking about?

272
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:35,937
It's the same word
as the other word.

273
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,986
- It's not the same word.
- Look, if I said the other word now,

274
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:39,396
you forced me to say
won't mean anything.

275
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:40,370
Plus, you haven't
said it either.

276
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:41,956
So don't get mad at me
for not saying it.

277
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:42,647
Yeah,
but I haven't said it

278
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:44,447
because guys always run
when you say it first.

279
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:45,497
Yeah, well,
so do girls.

280
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:47,278
Especially,
girls like you with options.

281
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,364
So this is all part
of your elaborate plan

282
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:52,531
to keep me interested?

283
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,080
Can be.

00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,821
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

316
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:56,069
<i>We have intel that I believe
warns an immediate debrief.</i>

317
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:58,516
<i>Now with your permission,
I can't let you see him</i>

318
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:00,811
<i>but I would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.</i>

319
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:01,790
Proceed.

320
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:21,499
You gotta wonder.

321
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:25,848
God made us in his image.
Who made him?

322
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:31,648
General, our alliance has countermanded
6 Decepticon incursions this year.

323
00:21:31,784 --> 00:21:34,249
Each on
a different continent.

324
00:21:34,612 --> 00:21:37,174
<i>They're clearly searching
around the world for something.</i>

325
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:40,606
<i>But last night's encounter
came with a warning:</i>

326
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:43,514
<i>The Fallen
shall rise again.</i>

327
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,718
"The Fallen."
Meaning what?

328
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,712
Origin: Unknown.

329
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:48,527
They only recorded

330
00:21:48,562 --> 00:21:52,027
<i>history of our race was contained
within the All-Spark,</i>

331
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:53,958
<i>lost with its destruction.</i>

332
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:54,979
Excuse me!

333
00:21:56,257 --> 00:22:00,173
If this so-called "All-Spark",
now destroyed,

334
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:03,196
why hasn't the enemy
left the planet

335
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:04,553
like you thought
they would?

336
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,986
<i>Director Galloway,
our national security advisor</i>

337
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:08,869
<i>the President
just appointed him liasion.</i>

338
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,279
- It's too, uh...
- Well, I guess I didn't get that memo.

339
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:17,564
Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me, coming through.

340
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,530
Excuse me,
excuse me...

341
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:23,414
After all the damage
in Shanghai,

342
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:24,755
<i>the President is, uh...</i>

343
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:27,086
hard-pressed to say
the job's getting done.

344
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:34,010
Now under the classified
Alien Autobot Cooperation Act,

345
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:37,174
<i>you are agreeing
to share your intel with us,</i>

346
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:39,486
but not your advancements
in weaponry.

347
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:43,146
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

348
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:47,013
It would absolutely
bring more harm than good.

349
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:50,099
But who are you
to judge what's best for us?

350
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,261
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side-by-side

351
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:53,794
in the field
for two years.

352
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,959
We've shared blood, sweat
and precious metal together.

353
00:22:57,326 --> 00:23:00,018
Soldier, you're paid to shoot;
not talk.

354
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:01,305
Don't tell me.

355
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:02,498
And the, uh...

356
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,061
- The newest members of your team...
- Easy...

357
00:23:05,393 --> 00:23:08,749
I understand they arrived here
after you sent a message into space.

358
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:10,769
An open invitation
to come to Earth,

359
00:23:10,804 --> 00:23:12,468
<i>embedded by no one
at the White House.</i>

360
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,634
Let me stop you
right there, Mr. Galloway.

361
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:16,188
It was bedded
right here.

362
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:20,240
<i>And in my experience, the judgement
of both Major Lennox and his team,</i>

363
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:23,309
has always been
above reproach.

364
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,150
<i>Well be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President</i>

365
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:28,226
<i>that when our national security
is at stake,</i>

366
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:31,842
<i>no one
is above reproach.</i>

367
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:35,027
Now, what do
we know so far?

368
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:37,631
We know
that the enemy leader,

369
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:41,427
<i>classified NBE-1,
AKA Megatron,</i>

370
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:43,137
<i>is resting in peace</i>

371
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,175
<i>at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyss,</i>

372
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,387
<i>surrounded by
societs detection nets</i>

373
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,798
<i>and a full-time
submarine surveillance.</i>

374
00:23:49,868 --> 00:23:50,894
We also know that

375
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:54,237
<i>the only remaining piece
of your alien All-Spark</i>

376
00:23:54,272 --> 00:23:56,312
<i>is locked in
an electromagnetic vault,</i>

377
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:59,891
<i>here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.</i>

378
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:04,395
Decepticons,
we have located the shard.

379
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:05,831
<i>And since no one...</i>

380
00:24:06,102 --> 00:24:10,080
can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

381
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,275
well, there--there's only
one clear conclusion:

382
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:16,522
You.
The Autobots.

383
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:19,451
They're here to hunt you.

384
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:22,411
What's there to hunt for
on Earth besides that?

385
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:25,063
"The Fallen...
shall rise again"?

386
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:26,881
Sounds to me like
something's coming.

387
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:30,633
So let me ask
if we ultimately conclude

388
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:32,519
that our national security
is best served

389
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,471
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

390
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:41,034
will you leave peacefully?

391
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:42,842
Freedom is your right.

392
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:46,054
If you make that request,
we will honor it.

393
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:52,537
But before your president decides,
please ask him this.

394
00:24:52,921 --> 00:24:57,531
What if we leave
and you're wrong?

395
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:06,217
That's a good question.

396
00:25:09,983 --> 00:25:11,303
Oh, my God,

397
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,643
just look at this place!

398
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:16,985
I feel smarter already.

399
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,173
Ron, can you smell it?

400
00:25:19,636 --> 00:25:21,764
Yes, smells
like $40,000 a year.

401
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:22,975
Okay, cheapo.

402
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:26,360
Go ahead, we'll, uh...
We'll get your stuff.

403
00:25:26,395 --> 00:25:27,735
Just go ahead
and check out your room.

Hey.

Uh, sorry, I already set up the crib.
Do you want this side or that side?

00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:48,361
- That side.
- I already chose that side.

410
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,024
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

411
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,705
Yeah, so you're trying to see
if I'm a normal guy.

412

I'm trying to see

Don't believe the hype, bro.

441
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:58,021
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

442
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:00,372
Yeah, I saw these robots
and they did this, like,

443
00:27:00,407 --> 00:27:02,768
firing thing and they came down
and twisted this woman

444
00:27:02,803 --> 00:27:04,128
- and she was like--
- Looks fake to me.

445
00:27:04,147 --> 00:27:07,194
Dude, it's not fake.
The Internet's pure true.

446
00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:09,248
- Neither does it lie.
- It looks fake.

447
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:11,326
No, man, I've seen them.
They are like these, uh, robots...

448
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:15,037
Look, look, look, it's fake.
Anybody can do on any computer, okay?

449
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,678
And I wasn't, uh... there.

450
00:27:17,111 --> 00:27:18,589
So I can't comment
or speculate.

451
00:27:18,624 --> 00:27:20,553
- Oh, no.
- "Comment and speculate"?

452
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:21,905
We're supposed
to go habitate?

453
00:27:21,945 --> 00:27:24,918
No, listen, okay.
Don't be sucking the sack, bro.

454
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,648
- Whose sack?
- Look, the ball sack.

455
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:29,894
- Dude, what kind of tool are you?
- Mainstream media sack.

They're lying to us,
alright.

Follow me.

459
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:38,303
Uh-oh. Uh, Leo.
Bad news, we just got scooped.

460
00:27:38,338 --> 00:27:39,714

No!

Robo-Warrior has a main competition,
our conspiracy step.

463
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:46,666
Effing was my effing idea.
He stole it.

464
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:49,205
He's been looking to my site
and thieving hits for ever!

465
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:50,505
By the way,
I read your file.

466
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,062
I'll pour, you'll pour...

00:37:26,297 --> 00:37:29,587
But the last fragment
of the All-Spark was stolen.

621
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:31,179
Like what?
Like Decepticon-stolen?

622
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:35,182
We placed it under human protection
at your government's request.

623
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:38,127
But I'm here
for your help, Sam.

624
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,270
Because your leaders believed
we brought vengeance upon your planet.

625
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:44,541
Perhaps,
they are right.

626
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,993
That is why they must be
reminded by another human

627
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:49,808
of the trust we share.

628
00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:52,872
- This isn't my war.
- Not yet.

629
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:56,048
But I fear
it soon will be.

630
00:37:56,658 --> 00:38:00,058
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron.

631
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:03,692
Whole generations lost.

632
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:10,376
I know and I-I want
to help you. I do.

633
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:12,862
But I'm not
some alien ambassador.

634
00:38:13,455 --> 00:38:15,567
You know, I'm a normal kid
with normal problems.

635
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:18,045
I am where
I'm supposed to be.

636
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,508
I'm sorry, I--

637
00:38:24,706 --> 00:38:25,818
I really am.

638
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:29,834
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing.

639
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:33,415
You're Optimus Prime.
You don't need me.

640
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,625
We do...
more than you know.

641
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:42,327
North Atlantic,
07:13 AM

642
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:12,218
USS Topeka SSN-754

643
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:15,357
<i>New contact, bearing 214
and possible hostile</i>

644
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:17,525
confirmed for
Project Beat Six drop-point.

645
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,372
- What you got?
- Sue, pull five contacts.

646
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:21,307
5,000 feet. Diving fast.

647
00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:27,644
There's something.
They dive that deep, that fast.

648
00:39:27,896 --> 00:39:30,767
- Man battle stations.
- Sealer One, man battle stations.

649
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:33,783
Hell, not pull the rudder
or head two-thirds.

650
00:39:34,765 --> 00:39:35,753
Dive, Cookie.

651
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,606
The NEST protecting NBE-1
are screening, sir.

652
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:02,736
That is 9,300 fathoms down.

653
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:05,249
- And no confirmed DSRVs on sight?
- None, sir.

654
00:40:05,284 --> 00:40:07,122
Then, people,
we've got a problem.

655
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:21,453
Kill such little one.

656
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:30,662
Sea shard, make Energon.

657
00:40:43,464 --> 00:40:46,857
Prime sonar now holds six contacts
and they're coming up fast.

658
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:48,082
Man collisional arm...

659
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,769
...are 500 feet.

660
00:40:51,804 --> 00:40:52,532
Let's get out of here.

661
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:53,580
Angel Six,

662
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,285
<i>we got six hostiles
coming down.</i>

663
00:41:03,138 --> 00:41:05,008
- Collision imminent. Portside--
- 100 feet.

664
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,475
Brace for impact.

665
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:36,167
Starscream, I'm home.

666
00:41:36,168 --> 00:41:38,702
Behold, Megatron,
I was so relieved

667
00:41:38,737 --> 00:41:41,024
to hear of your...
resurrection.

668
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:44,960
You left me to die,
you pathetic insect!

669
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:48,415
Only to help
spawn our new army,

670
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:52,525
the Fallen decreased it,
after all, in your absence,

671
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,973
someone had
to take command.

672
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:55,890
You...

673
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:58,504
are so disappointing.

674
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:04,266
Even in death,
there's no command but mine.

675
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:13,739
My master,
I failed you on Earth.

676
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:16,308
The All-Spark is destroyed,

677
00:42:16,343 --> 00:42:19,613
and without it,
our race will perish.

678
00:42:20,236 --> 00:42:23,242
You have much to learn,
my disciple.

679
00:42:23,277 --> 00:42:25,873
The Cube
is merely a vessel.

680
00:42:25,903 --> 00:42:29,625
It's power, it's knowledge
can never be destroyed.

681
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:32,663
It can only transform.

682
00:42:32,698 --> 00:42:36,020
- How is that possible?
- It has been absorbed

683
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,956
by the human child.

684
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:43,118
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

685
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:46,861
Well then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body.

686
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:48,843
And you will,
my apprentice.

687
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,862
In time. For millenia,
I have dreamed of my return

688
00:42:53,897 --> 00:42:58,763
to that wretched planet,
where I too was once betrayed,

689
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:02,720
by the Primes
I call my brothers.

690
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:10,259
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now only one remains.

691
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:13,967
Optimus.
He protects the boy.

692
00:43:14,002 --> 00:43:17,402
Then the boy
will lead us to him

693
00:43:17,403 --> 00:43:22,933
- and revenge will be ours.
- Yes.

694
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:27,945
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

695
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:33,214
Without more Energon,
hatchlings will keep dying.

696
00:43:38,473 --> 00:43:43,317
Space, time, gravity.

697
00:43:46,895 --> 00:43:49,045
- Thank you.
- Finish that for me.

698
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,587
We're going
on a journey together,

699
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:52,818
you and I, today.

700
00:43:52,853 --> 00:43:57,692
All you, eager nubile young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

701
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:01,311
And I shall be your consort,
your guide,

702
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:05,762
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

703
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:10,105
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

704
00:44:11,705 --> 00:44:15,529
For what do we know
about the stars?

705
00:44:15,763 --> 00:44:19,603
Virgo... the virgin.

706
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:22,374
Orion, the great hunter.

707
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:24,562
These are no mere
twinkling diamonds

708
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:27,055
for lovely maidens
to wish upon.

709
00:44:27,076 --> 00:44:31,407
No, they are diamond,
filled with a throbbing,

710
00:44:31,442 --> 00:44:34,228
savage and hemped-up energy.

711
00:44:34,263 --> 00:44:36,905
Behold the work of
Albert Einstein,

712
00:44:37,018 --> 00:44:39,621
a professor once,
like moi,

713
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:42,004
- energy, in its mass temp--
- What are you doing?

714
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:43,007
Put your hand down,
put your hand down.

715
00:44:43,008 --> 00:44:45,487
Young man,
there are no questions

716
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:47,580
until I've reached
the climax of my lecture.

717
00:44:47,615 --> 00:44:48,923
I've just finished your book.
There's only one problem.

718
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:49,958
Einstein's wrong.

719
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:53,542
Energy doesn't go
mass times velocity light square

720
00:44:53,562 --> 00:44:54,851
in this dimension.
What about the other 17

721
00:44:54,886 --> 00:44:56,316
while we're impossible
to give 17?

722
00:44:58,054 --> 00:44:58,868
A clear example:

723
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,556
Come on, guys,
I can't be the only one in class--

724
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:23,227
Young man, I will not be punked
in front of the dean.

725
00:45:24,706 --> 00:45:29,658
No, this is my universe here.
Do you understand?

726
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:33,312
I am the Alpha
and the Omega.

727
00:45:33,347 --> 00:45:34,687
- Get out of my class.
- Yes, sir.

728
00:45:38,812 --> 00:45:41,304
Any one else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

729
00:45:51,343 --> 00:45:53,844
Hi, Bones.
Hi!

730
00:45:54,178 --> 00:45:56,735
Hi! Oh yes,
that's a good boy.

731
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:58,945
<i>Oh, what a good boy,
you are.</i>

732
00:46:03,705 --> 00:46:04,881
Hey, Bones.

733
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:06,735
<i>You hungry?</i>

734
00:46:14,195 --> 00:46:14,888
Here you go.

735
00:46:23,343 --> 00:46:25,307
- Yes, Samuel.
- Hello? Mikaela.

736
00:46:25,426 --> 00:46:28,174
I can't believe you're gonna
stand me up on our first web chat date.

737
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:29,468
Something just happened
to me, okay?

738
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:31,472
<i>- Wait, you finally hit puberty?
- No, no, no,</i>

739
00:46:31,507 --> 00:46:32,494
Stop laughing.
This is serious.

740
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:33,405
Okay, remember
I was telling you about

741
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,426
my great-great-grandfather,
Archibald Witwicky?

742
00:46:35,427 --> 00:46:36,260
Do you remember?

743
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:37,600
Watch where you're
supposed to go!

744
00:46:37,601 --> 00:46:39,992
Okay, remember
I was telling you about, okay...

745
00:46:40,027 --> 00:46:41,888
Can you stop...
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

746
00:46:41,923 --> 00:46:44,939
Mikaela, okay, my great-great-grandfather
went to this Arctic mission, right?

747
00:46:44,974 --> 00:46:46,790
And he saw Megatron,
Megatron zapped him

748
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,706
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols, okay.

749
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,158
Well, now I'm seeing them too.
Excuse me.

750
00:46:50,176 --> 00:46:52,798
I just wrote a 903-page
Astronomy book at 32.6 seconds

751
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,294
and had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

752
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:56,365
I am seeing symbols
ever since I--

753
00:46:57,651 --> 00:47:00,554
- Since what?
- Ever since I touched the Cube sliver.

754
00:47:01,814 --> 00:47:02,652
Do you have it?

755
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:05,334
No, how about it's in
the shop safe? It's fine.

756
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:08,509
Mi--Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?
Don't touch it.

757
00:47:08,549 --> 00:47:09,557
<i>I'm not gonna touch it,</i>

758
00:47:09,685 --> 00:47:12,370
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away,
no one knows where it is.

759
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,917
But I do.

760
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:17,698
You're hot,
but you're ain't too bright.

761
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:21,434
There we go.

762
00:47:24,245 --> 00:47:26,627
Oh, big son of a bitch!

763
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,334
What are you looking at,
Slobberpuss?

764
00:47:32,457 --> 00:47:33,671
Ah, what the--

765
00:47:34,749 --> 00:47:36,380
This is a fricking
House of Horrors.

766
00:47:42,683 --> 00:47:43,683
Hold on.

767
00:47:57,196 --> 00:47:59,046
Is that the best
you got, huh?

768
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:00,395
Is that the best
you can do?

769
00:48:02,084 --> 00:48:03,746
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

770
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,721
Ow, that's my eye,
you crazy bitch!

771
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:08,216
You gotta talk now?

772
00:48:08,993 --> 00:48:12,432
I... I seek knowledge of the Cube.
The Fallen demands me.

773
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:13,249
What knowledge?

774
00:48:13,284 --> 00:48:15,258
You got the shot, I need the shot,
give me the shot, I need the shot.

775
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:16,138
Give me the shot,
they're gonna whack me,

776
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:17,459
I'm gonna be dead
without that shot.

777
00:48:17,927 --> 00:48:21,597
Easy Warrior Goddess,
I'm just a little salvage scrap drone.

778
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,481
- Then I'm your worst nightmare.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!

779
00:48:23,924 --> 00:48:24,675
Hey, hey!

780
00:48:24,954 --> 00:48:26,443
<i>- What the hell was that?
- I'll tell you later,</i>

781
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:28,012
just not on
open phone line, okay?

782
00:48:28,051 --> 00:48:30,086
I'm gonna get on a plane right now.
I'll be there later this afternoon.

783
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:31,267
Just be careful, Sam.

784
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,311
And have any stranger giving you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

785
00:48:42,346 --> 00:48:43,775
Yeah, a large box!

786
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:45,516
- No.
- Good.

787
00:48:58,156 --> 00:49:00,791
Major, incoming SOS
from Autobots.

788
00:49:00,826 --> 00:49:04,571
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity eastern United States, sir.

789
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:07,513
- Hansvin, how many?
- Unclear, sir.

790
00:49:07,795 --> 00:49:09,399
Well, get clear.

791
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,894
Autobots on the move.
Splitting them into two teams, sir.

792
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:19,576
Unarching their course, somewhere heading
to New York and Philadelphia.

793
00:49:19,611 --> 00:49:23,181
Full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

00:49:36,993 --> 00:49:41,015
M'amor (my lover), can I interest you
in Mayteam Zookeeper's Special?

796
00:49:41,096 --> 00:49:43,434
Extra large supertees
with every known animal as a topping.

797
00:49:43,435 --> 00:49:45,466
Basic lengths.
Only 18 inches of meat.

798
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:47,616
Oh, so you're a vegetarian.
Alright, it's cool. I am too.

799
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,250
Is Sam home?

800
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:52,539
Sam... I think he died but,
why don't we check?

801
00:49:53,145 --> 00:49:54,490
- Here we are.
- Hey.

802
00:49:55,105 --> 00:49:56,197
Have you had
a song stuck in yours?

803
00:49:56,198 --> 00:49:57,603
It's like the worst song ever,
but you can't help

804
00:49:57,638 --> 00:49:59,215
whistle it or sing it.
It's like, repeats itself,

805
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,410
repeats itself, repeats itself,
repeats itself, repeats itself,

00:50:01,411 --> 00:50:03,442
repeats itself...
Kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

00:50:03,473 --> 00:50:04,501
- kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
- Dude,

808
00:50:04,536 --> 00:50:05,730
- kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
- What the F?

809
00:50:05,764 --> 00:50:07,859
I know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out, don't freak out.

810
00:50:07,911 --> 00:50:10,777
Easy fix. Puzzle, code, in my head.
Now it's on the walls.

811
00:50:10,812 --> 00:50:11,552
Everything is good.

812
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:12,477
This is the part that--

813
00:50:17,352 --> 00:50:18,418
Okay,
what were you saying?

814
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:21,854
Alice, I'm horrified you had
to see this. Let's go.

815
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:23,419
- Get out.
- What?

816
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,551
Wait, wait, wait.
C-Can I just sit and watch?

817
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:27,118
I-I'll eat my pizza quietly.

818
00:50:27,783 --> 00:50:30,680
Sam, I knew there were
something special about you.

819
00:50:30,715 --> 00:50:31,328
Really?

820
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:35,371
And I know you know
what happens

821
00:50:35,636 --> 00:50:37,685
when two people
in the room get together...

822
00:50:38,773 --> 00:50:42,469
they're genuinely amazing...
in bed.

823
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,213
- Thank you.
- No problem.

824
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:49,064
Alright, listen, hold on.
Boundaries. Flight on the plane.

825
00:50:49,093 --> 00:50:50,408
Okay, I'm very ticklish.

826
00:50:50,443 --> 00:50:53,035
- You have the need, Sam. Relax!
- Why?

827
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,398
Oh, jeez!

828
00:50:55,656 --> 00:50:58,599
Uh, what about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?

829
00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:04,827
- You are very aggressive.
- Just relax.

830
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:06,274
You want
some jerky meatloaf?

831
00:51:12,129 --> 00:51:13,032

834
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:18,290
Is that your girlfriend?

835
00:51:19,582 --> 00:51:20,578
Ex.

836
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:26,507
Mikaela, wait...
I can explain every--

837
00:51:45,966 --> 00:51:47,587
Sam, your bed-buddy, Alice.

838
00:52:07,636 --> 00:52:08,124
What--

839
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:09,227
- It's coming!
- This is an alien robot.

840
00:52:09,262 --> 00:52:10,844
- You gotta move. Just run.
- They're real?

841
00:52:17,727 --> 00:52:20,310
Oh my God, I can't believe
I once had sex with her in my dream.

842
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,954
I can tell that you really
missed me a lot, Sam.

843
00:52:21,984 --> 00:52:23,040
Look, it's not my fault, okay?

844
00:52:23,844 --> 00:52:25,208
Listen, listen.
I'm a victim.

845
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:26,553
Oh, you were a victim?
Of what?

846
00:52:26,588 --> 00:52:28,670
- Of what? A little 80-pound girl--
- Of--Of...

847
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,438
It's like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox.

848
00:52:30,453 --> 00:52:31,834
You didn't have to put
your tongue in her mouth.

849
00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:32,839
- I didn't.
- You did.

850
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:35,291
Look, you ever had your stomach tounged
by a mountain ox with a 5-foot tong?

851
00:52:35,326 --> 00:52:36,967
It's not fun for me,
okay, Mikaela.

852
00:52:37,002 --> 00:52:40,650
And it smelled like--like diesel.
Like a diesel he dinged to it.

853
00:52:40,685 --> 00:52:42,140
You're such a little girl.

854
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:44,222
You have ten seconds
of silence, right now.

855
00:52:44,257 --> 00:52:45,498
I'm not talking to you
for ten seconds.

856
00:52:45,528 --> 00:52:47,293
No, you can't give me the silence.
You know what?

857
00:52:47,506 --> 00:52:49,928
I'm not talking to you for ten seconds.
You have three seconds left.

858
00:52:49,963 --> 00:52:51,321
You know, what?
You can give me the silence you want,

859
00:52:51,356 --> 00:52:53,057
all you want but you can't
give me the talking...

860
00:52:53,399 --> 00:52:54,207
W-What were you gonna say?

861
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:55,707
I hope you had a lot of fun
because this--

862
00:52:55,742 --> 00:52:56,942
This is over!

863
00:52:56,985 --> 00:52:58,223
Did she finally led you
to orbits?

864
00:52:58,253 --> 00:53:00,833
You threw a broom?
She did it, she went in it?

865
00:53:02,538 --> 00:53:05,114
...gestating in that inside of you.
You're going right now, bro.

866
00:53:04,686 --> 00:53:06,748
You need to vomit right now.
Yak it, yak it.

867
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:08,841
- Right now!
- Who are you?

868
00:53:09,056 --> 00:53:11,176
I am the only one who
everybody can spit, okay?

869
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:12,031
I'm the key to this.

870
00:53:12,212 --> 00:53:13,788
Aliens; they want me
because of my site.

871
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:14,723
Whoa!

872
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:25,959
Run!

873
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:31,530
Mikaela!

874
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:50,505
Watch out.
We get in.

875
00:53:51,476 --> 00:53:52,634
It's a bomb!

876
00:54:02,645 --> 00:54:03,810
We gotta get
that box.

877
00:54:07,557 --> 00:54:08,339
This way.

878
00:54:08,554 --> 00:54:10,534
<i>Hey, let me out,
let me out!</i>

879
00:54:11,631 --> 00:54:13,473
Oh my God,
you know to hot-wire a car?

880
00:54:13,746 --> 00:54:15,257
- That's so hot.
- Drive, drive, drive.

881
00:54:15,292 --> 00:54:16,497
She went there,
she went there!

882
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:21,082
W-wait!

883
00:54:21,176 --> 00:54:22,263
They can....

884
00:54:26,032 --> 00:54:27,628
Cut, cut, cut.

885
00:54:34,473 --> 00:54:35,594
Oh God!

886
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,876
Kiss this, bitch.

887
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,703
Drive, drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive.

888
00:54:53,232 --> 00:54:54,669
Okay, so what else's
going right now, alright,

889
00:54:54,669 --> 00:54:56,200
did you guys just mess
with the minor details?

890
00:54:58,692 --> 00:55:00,839
Thing you saw back there.
That was a little babe.

891
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,762
Whoa!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

892
00:55:12,653 --> 00:55:13,900
Sam!

893
00:55:18,475 --> 00:55:19,600
- Sam!
- Hold on!

894
00:55:20,084 --> 00:55:20,809
Hold on.

895
00:55:23,284 --> 00:55:24,291
Sam!

896
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:29,736
I don't want to die!
We're going to die! Oh my God!

897
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:56,720
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, jeez!

898
00:56:05,346 --> 00:56:07,087
Come here, boy.

899
00:56:08,353 --> 00:56:09,702
Closer.

900
00:56:11,158 --> 00:56:11,625
Okay.

901
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:15,266
- You remember me, don't you?
- I did what you said, okay?

902
00:56:16,427 --> 00:56:17,971
- Just don't hurt us.
- Shut up!

903
00:56:18,883 --> 00:56:19,779
Sam!

904
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:33,703
It feels good
to grab your first.

905
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:39,943
I am going to kill you,
slowly, painfully.

906
00:56:39,978 --> 00:56:44,548
But first, we have
some delicate work to do.

907
00:56:48,211 --> 00:56:50,374
I could snap your ribs off.

908
00:56:50,736 --> 00:56:54,543
Doctor, examine
this alien specimen.

909
00:56:57,028 --> 00:56:58,647
Sick of your face now.

910
00:57:19,825 --> 00:57:21,637
Go that way.

911
00:57:29,662 --> 00:57:31,087
A wormy that's crabby--

912
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:46,410
- Oh, there they are.
- That's what I'm seeing in my head.

913
00:57:46,446 --> 00:57:49,403
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

914
00:57:50,423 --> 00:57:52,948
We must tear the brain!

915
00:57:55,343 --> 00:57:58,280
Brain?
What does he mean by my brain?

916
00:57:58,315 --> 00:58:00,404
Well, you have something
on your mind.

917
00:58:00,438 --> 00:58:02,786
- Something I need.
- Hold on. I know you're pissed.

918
00:58:02,806 --> 00:58:03,484
I know you're pissed.

919
00:58:03,515 --> 00:58:05,413
Because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

920
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:06,993
Somebody tried to kill me,
I'd be upset too.

921
00:58:07,028 --> 00:58:09,524
I think that
we have an opportunity here

922
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:12,577
to start a new and--and
develop our relationship,

923
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:15,163
and--and,
see where it leads us, okay?

924
00:58:15,198 --> 00:58:16,405
So you just call
doctor inspection,

925
00:58:16,441 --> 00:58:18,087
I'll let you talk
in five seconds.

926
00:58:18,408 --> 00:58:19,048
W-Wait...

927
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:26,609
Go, go.

928
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:31,763
Go, go, go.

929
00:58:58,742 --> 00:58:59,737
Sam!

930
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:17,111
Go, go, go, go!

931
00:59:18,145 --> 00:59:19,189
Here he comes!

932
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:29,620
Hide, Sam!
Hide.

933
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:39,527
Weak.

934
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:42,880
Puny.

935
00:59:43,441 --> 00:59:44,365
Voiced-up.

936
00:59:48,734 --> 00:59:51,365
Junkyard drone.

937
00:59:52,353 --> 00:59:54,122
Decepticons!

938
01:00:03,515 --> 01:00:05,518
Come here, boy.

939
01:00:35,478 --> 01:00:38,908
There is another source of Energon
hidden on this planet.

940
01:00:38,943 --> 01:00:41,022
The boy can lead us to it.

941
01:00:45,582 --> 01:00:46,960
Optimus!

942
01:01:00,252 --> 01:01:05,761
Is the future of our race
not worth a single human life?

943
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:06,919
Op, get up!

944
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,374
You'll never stop at one.

945
01:01:10,687 --> 01:01:12,618
I'll take you all alive.

946
01:01:54,372 --> 01:01:56,193
Sam, where are you?

947
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,407
You are so weak.

948
01:02:27,525 --> 01:02:32,021
At last, Prime is dead.

949
01:02:40,237 --> 01:02:42,540
Sam, run.

950
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:56,735
Autobots, attack!

951
01:03:01,564 --> 01:03:03,103
Bumblebee,
get them out of here.

952
01:03:17,048 --> 01:03:18,090
This is Lennox.

953
01:03:30,983 --> 01:03:32,379
That went well.

954
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:34,779
Lost the boy, Master.

955
01:03:34,819 --> 01:03:37,237
The Autobots must be shielding
the signals.

956
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:40,020
- I can't even rely on you.
- Sorry. No.

957
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,219
What a simple insect!

958
01:03:43,478 --> 01:03:46,415
- What insect amongst severed billion--
- Shut up.

959
01:03:48,045 --> 01:03:49,691
It could be anywhere.

960
01:03:50,382 --> 01:03:53,879
Then we will force them
to find him for us.

961
01:03:54,193 --> 01:03:57,158
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.

962
01:03:57,453 --> 01:04:00,684
No more disguises,
no mercy!

963
01:04:00,985 --> 01:04:04,607
Time has come
for my master's arrival.

964
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:11,968
Decepticons, mobilise.

965
01:04:11,969 --> 01:04:13,975
It is time.

966
01:04:28,547 --> 01:04:31,086
<i>Oh, that single's good!</i>

967
01:04:31,287 --> 01:04:33,600
<i>Speaking French
is so exciting.</i>

968
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:35,457
Oh God,
who is this?

969
01:04:37,411 --> 01:04:40,417
Hello-- I mean,
uh, bon--bonswa (good afternoon)!

970
01:04:41,584 --> 01:04:43,566
What?
Who is this?

971
01:04:44,937 --> 01:04:46,437
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

972
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:49,504
I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth breathing.

973
01:04:50,942 --> 01:04:52,803
New York City

974
01:05:29,777 --> 01:05:30,893
Oh, jeez.

975
01:05:31,084 --> 01:05:33,688
You are invading my space.
I'm gonna have to drop you.

976
01:05:33,723 --> 01:05:34,863
Would you get out
of here?

977
01:05:35,096 --> 01:05:36,866
Might freak me out.

978
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:38,794
We're gonna try
new things.

979
01:05:38,844 --> 01:05:40,417
Looks like Candian goosepoop.

980
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:43,972
It's nasty.

981
01:05:44,454 --> 01:05:47,440
US Fleet 2, North Atlantic

982
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:50,716
That's fine, 1-2-5.

983
01:06:56,336 --> 01:06:59,872
Revenge is mine.

984

Pentagon,

989
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:52,420
<i>Citizens

990
01:07:52,752 --> 01:07:56,386
<i>your leaders

991
01:07:56,475 --> 01:08:00,437
<i>You are not alone

992

<i>but no more.</i>

994
01:08:07,342 --> 01:08:09,244
<i>As you've seen,</i>

995
01:08:09,512 --> 01:08:12,383
<i>we can destroy
your cities at will.</i>

996
01:08:14,364 --> 01:08:17,850
<i>Unless you turn over
this boy.</i>

997
01:08:22,426 --> 01:08:24,575
<i>If you resist us,</i>

998
01:08:24,835 --> 01:08:29,255
<i>we will destroy the world,

999
01:08:29,556 --> 01:08:31,368
<i>What we're hearing from
the German government is that</i>

1000
01:08:31,419 --> 01:08:34,233
<i>the world broadcast

<i>President Obama

<i>Worldwide casualties

could implode.</i>

1012
01:08:59,324 --> 01:09:00,560
It's still too early to tell.

1013
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:02,817
What we need to ask now,
is who and why.

1014
01:09:02,818 --> 01:09:05,808
<i>The FBI is still trying
to locate the boy, Sam Witwicky.</i>

1015
01:09:05,843 --> 01:09:08,644
Within deep, they have information
about this.

1016
01:09:08,884 --> 01:09:11,097
The FBI, CIA and Interpol

1017
01:09:11,132 --> 01:09:14,261
<i>are all seeking the cooperation
of worldwide law enforcements.</i>

1018
01:09:14,293 --> 01:09:15,481
Hey bro, you need
to listen to this, man.

1019
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:17,442
<i>- You gotta check this out.
- Once they have a traffic camera</i>

1020
01:09:17,477 --> 01:09:19,396
<i>- spotting a Sam Witwicky.
- They have a picture of me, man.</i>

1021
01:09:19,431 --> 01:09:23,100
We're dead, bro.
FBI, CIA, we're wanted fugitives now.

1022
01:09:23,154 --> 01:09:24,838
I just need you to focus
just one minute, man.

1023
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:26,635
This thing is blowing
to a whole another level, alright.

1024
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:28,120
- You know one thing--
- Remove this thing.

1025
01:09:28,121 --> 01:09:29,207
They can track us.
Do you see this?

1026
01:09:29,242 --> 01:09:29,947
What?

1027
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,542
They can track us?

1028
01:09:33,756 --> 01:09:35,295
Like satellite-track us?

1029
01:09:35,488 --> 01:09:37,508
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
I'm not even with you guys.

1030
01:09:37,539 --> 01:09:40,110
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping. Enough--

1031
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:41,404
Yo, Leo!

1032
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:43,836
This thing's gonna give me
a heart attack, I swear.

1033
01:09:43,871 --> 01:09:45,868
- That's 'cause you was a wuss.
- You did force me into the car, right?

1034
01:09:45,903 --> 01:09:47,236
- So...
- Oh, I think you scared.

1035
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:48,205
Hey, Mudflap.

1036
01:09:48,414 --> 01:09:49,826
What are we going to do
with this shrimp taco?

1037
01:09:49,866 --> 01:09:51,440
Just pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

1038
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:52,766
and nobody gonna know nothing,
y'know I mean?

1039
01:09:52,801 --> 01:09:54,777
- Wait, now my trunk--
- Yo, bumper cars,

1040
01:09:54,778 --> 01:09:56,450
Check it out.
I'm hearing you, okay?

1041
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,251
I'm right here
and I can hear you.

1042
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:00,855
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

1043
01:10:00,874 --> 01:10:02,318
I've had a hell of a day.

1044
01:10:03,383 --> 01:10:05,739
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

1045
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:06,866
Go whine
to your boyfriend.

1046
01:10:06,871 --> 01:10:08,571
Listen Sam, I know
what I'm gonna do, man.

1047
01:10:08,606 --> 01:10:09,695
Look, I'm just going to go
to the authorities

1048
01:10:09,737 --> 01:10:11,233
and tell them the truth.
Like I had nothing to do with this,

1049
01:10:11,252 --> 01:10:12,084
- I'm an accomplice.
- Hey, hey!

1050
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:13,728
You wanted this, right?
You wanted the real deal?

1051
01:10:13,769 --> 01:10:15,864
'Cause that's what this is.
Wake up! You're in the middle of it.

1052
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:17,864
You wanna run, go ahead,
no one's stopping you.

1053
01:10:19,171 --> 01:10:20,376
Stop complaining.

1054
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:58,464
What is the meaning
of this?

1055
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,891
You dare
point your gun at me?

1056
01:11:00,892 --> 01:11:04,722
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!

1057
01:11:06,552 --> 01:11:08,886
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

1058
01:11:08,921 --> 01:11:10,627
- Tell them to lower the weapons.
- Tell them first.

1059
01:11:10,658 --> 01:11:12,766
- Tell them to lower the weapons!
- Major, there's nothing I can do.

1060
01:11:12,805 --> 01:11:13,581
Talk to him.

1061
01:11:13,883 --> 01:11:15,735
US teams deactivated, Major.

1062
01:11:16,278 --> 01:11:18,877
You are decease
anti-Decepticon operations,

1063
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:21,280
and return to Diego Garcia.
Any further orders?

1064
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,534
No. We take our orders
direct from Chairman Morshower.

1065
01:11:23,574 --> 01:11:25,749
Well, I'll see your chairman
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1066
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,109
but I will raise you
a President of the United States.

1067
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:29,780
I have operational command now.

1068
01:11:29,815 --> 01:11:32,148
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

1069
01:11:32,183 --> 01:11:33,870
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

1070
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:37,342
The secret is out.
This is our war now.

1071
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:39,219
And we will win it
as we always have,

1072
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,493
with a coordinated
military strategy.

1073
01:11:41,528 --> 01:11:44,170
This fool
is terribly misinformed.

1074
01:11:44,363 --> 01:11:45,929
You're gonna get every assets
that you've got.

1075
01:11:45,964 --> 01:11:47,668
What we need is
to draw our battle plans.

1076
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:50,044
What we explore every possible,
diplomatic solution.

1077
01:11:50,045 --> 01:11:51,459
Like what:
Handing over the kid?

1078
01:11:52,846 --> 01:11:54,538
All options
are being considered.

1079
01:11:55,322 --> 01:11:57,298
Whatever the Decepticons
are after,

1080
01:11:57,670 --> 01:11:59,119
this is just the start.

1081
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,862
Wait, there is no negotiating
with them.

1082
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,535
I'm ordering you
to stand down.

1083
01:12:02,536 --> 01:12:03,965
You won't be needing this
any more.

1084
01:12:04,348 --> 01:12:06,374
Get your assets
back to base.

1085
01:12:06,886 --> 01:12:09,490
Take that scrap metal
back to Diego Garcia.

1086
01:12:11,354 --> 01:12:11,705
Let's go.

1087
01:12:13,434 --> 01:12:15,113
I really don't
like that dude.

1088
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:17,570
He's a asshole.

1089
01:12:17,831 --> 01:12:20,248
<i>Autobots,
report to hangar for transport.</i>

1090
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:23,079
Ironhide,
we should leave this planet.

1091
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:25,635
That's not what
Optimus would want.

1092
01:12:44,844 --> 01:12:46,565
There's nothing
that you could have done.

1093
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:53,464
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1094
01:12:56,643 --> 01:12:59,451
Bee, if you hate me,
I understand.

1095
01:13:07,305 --> 01:13:08,474
I messed up.

1096
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:10,883
I'm sorry.

1097
01:13:12,493 --> 01:13:16,636
- Young fella, you are...
- ...person I care about most in my life.

1098
01:13:16,671 --> 01:13:19,474
- If there's anything you need...
- I won't be far away.

1099
01:13:21,741 --> 01:13:23,126
He's dead
because of me.

1100
01:13:23,895 --> 01:13:25,616
He came in
to protect me instead.

1101
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:28,641
There's some things
you just can't change.

1102
01:13:28,676 --> 01:13:30,151
So this sacrifice was...

1103
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:32,884
will not have been in vain,
hallelujah!

1104
01:13:34,354 --> 01:13:36,180
We make it right
when we turn myself in.

1105
01:13:36,423 --> 01:13:38,401
But we,
we've got to stick together.

1106
01:13:43,078 --> 01:13:44,798
You're not gonna do that.

1107
01:13:46,326 --> 01:13:47,062
Yes, I am.

1108
01:13:51,192 --> 01:13:53,879
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

1109
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,109
In one day.

1110
01:13:57,814 --> 01:13:59,251
- You two.
- Huh?

1111
01:13:59,805 --> 01:14:00,981
Hey, you know the glyphs?

1112
01:14:01,736 --> 01:14:03,531
The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head.

1113
01:14:04,071 --> 01:14:06,124
That's old school, yo.

1114
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,298
That's like--
That's Cybertonian.

1115
01:14:08,337 --> 01:14:09,903
Oh, that's some
serious stuff in there.

1116
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,561
They gotta mean something,
like a message...

1117
01:14:11,596 --> 01:14:12,948
or, like a--
like a map!

1118
01:14:12,983 --> 01:14:14,525
Like a map
to an Energon source.

1119
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:15,291
Can you read this?

1120
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:17,126
- Read? Nah.
- You see that?

1121
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,711
No, we--we don't really do
much reading.

1122
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:21,004
- Not so much.
- Well if you can't read it,

1123
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:21,941
we gotta find
somebody who can.

1124
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:24,028
Oh, look, who came
stashing and back.

1125
01:14:24,063 --> 01:14:25,717
Hair grown like a chip,
there, look it.

1126
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,890
I had a bit of a mild
panic attack earlier, alright?

1127
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,850
That's 'cause
you're a pussy.

1128
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:30,898
I think I'm allowed that
considering what I've been through

1129
01:14:30,928 --> 01:14:32,456
and... I heard
you have a problem.

1130
01:14:32,475 --> 01:14:34,108
I think I know someone
who can help.

1131
01:14:34,362 --> 01:14:36,695
- Who?
- Robo-Warrior.

1132
01:14:37,569 --> 01:14:40,328
[SONG: New Divide
BAND: Linkin Park]

1133
01:14:40,471 --> 01:14:41,735
This guy, Robo-Warrior...

1134
01:14:41,775 --> 01:14:44,326
Everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.

1135
01:14:44,361 --> 01:14:45,728
One time
we hacked this site

1136
01:14:45,757 --> 01:14:50,402
and maybe, I saw some of your, uh...
alien drawings or whatever.

1137
01:15:00,103 --> 01:15:00,103
let my wretched self.

1138
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:03,769
This is it.

1139
01:15:04,395 --> 01:15:06,103
Yep, deli. Good front.

1140
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,978
Alright, wait here.
I'll give you the go/no go, alright?

1141
01:15:09,852 --> 01:15:15,143
Number 42, we got your...
Right here...

1142
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:16,935
Show me Who's next ?

1143
01:15:20,225 --> 01:15:21,850
Ma, you want me
to cut my handle off or what?

1144
01:15:21,891 --> 01:15:24,934
- You order a terrible piece of fishing.
- I'm like a ninja, with a blade.

1145
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:26,017
Get out of here!

1146
01:15:26,017 --> 01:15:28,433
Hey, Sam!
Watch your reach, huh?

1147
01:15:28,474 --> 01:15:29,932
Take a number,
young man.

1148
01:15:30,516 --> 01:15:31,683
Robo-Warrior.

1149
01:15:33,681 --> 01:15:34,390
Know him?

1150
01:15:34,723 --> 01:15:35,890
I never heard of him.

1151
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,181
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal.com?

1152
01:15:38,181 --> 01:15:41,015
You must be talking about
that amateur blog operation

1153
01:15:41,056 --> 01:15:43,222
with GameBoy level security.

1154
01:15:43,222 --> 01:15:44,431
Robo-Warrior.

1155
01:15:45,223 --> 01:15:47,263
It's him. It's him!
That's the guy right there.

1156
01:15:47,305 --> 01:15:48,221
That's him.

1157
01:15:49,306 --> 01:15:50,263
No.

1158
01:15:51,263 --> 01:15:52,305
You gotta be kidding me.

1159
01:15:52,305 --> 01:15:54,803
Alright, meat store's closed.
Everybody out!

1160
01:15:54,803 --> 01:15:55,929
Go, right now!

1161
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,095
Wait a minute,
you know this guy?

1162
01:15:59,095 --> 01:16:00,595
- We're old friends.
- Whoa, friend,

1163
01:16:00,636 --> 01:16:03,303
you are the case
that shut down Sector 7.

1164
01:16:03,303 --> 01:16:04,845
Got the tie-bash
disbandment,

1165
01:16:04,887 --> 01:16:08,177
no more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

1166
01:16:08,218 --> 01:16:11,302
All 'cause of you,
and your little criminal girlfriend.

1167
01:16:11,302 --> 01:16:12,844
Look at her now,
so mature.

1168
01:16:12,844 --> 01:16:15,676
Moron, where's the wifresh?

1169
01:16:15,676 --> 01:16:17,592
Don't catch me
with the thing.

1170
01:16:17,675 --> 01:16:19,009
- Yakov!
- What?

1171
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:21,259
You don't get Christmas bonus
just standing around.

1172
01:16:21,384 --> 01:16:23,216
You want those new teeth
you saw in SkyMall?

1173
01:16:23,466 --> 01:16:25,342
- It's my dream.
- Help around.

1174
01:16:26,175 --> 01:16:28,008
- You live with your momma?
- No, my momma lives with me,

1175
01:16:28,049 --> 01:16:28,632
it's a big difference.

1176
01:16:28,674 --> 01:16:30,632
They got your face
all over the news, alien boy.

1177
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:32,757
- Yeah, I know.
- And NBE-1, still kicking, huh?

1178
01:16:33,049 --> 01:16:34,089
How did that happen?

1179
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:36,382
Don't answer.
I don't know what you're hiding,

1180
01:16:36,423 --> 01:16:37,674
but I don't want anything
to do with it

1181
01:16:37,716 --> 01:16:40,048
so, goodbye, you never saw me.
I got bagels to schmidt.

1182
01:16:40,382 --> 01:16:41,756
Well, give me 5 seconds.

1183
01:16:41,756 --> 01:16:43,255
Look, hold on,
I need your help.

1184
01:16:43,297 --> 01:16:45,715
Really,
you need my help?

1185
01:16:46,005 --> 01:16:46,589
I need--

1186
01:16:46,881 --> 01:16:49,172
Look, I am slowly
losing my mind, okay?

1187
01:16:49,255 --> 01:16:51,046
I had a little Crabbot,
placed the device

1188
01:16:51,088 --> 01:16:52,629
deep into the soft tissues
of my brain,

1189
01:16:52,671 --> 01:16:54,336
and started projecting
little alien symbols

1190
01:16:54,378 --> 01:16:55,336
like a whole freaking movie

1191
01:16:55,378 --> 01:16:57,129
and on top of that,
I'm a wanted fugitive.

1192
01:16:57,171 --> 01:16:58,295
So you think
you got it rough?

1193
01:16:58,295 --> 01:17:00,504
You said it projected images
of your brain?

1194
01:17:00,504 --> 01:17:01,295
Right.

1195
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:03,253
Meat locker, now!

1196
01:17:03,878 --> 01:17:05,128
- Dead pigs.
- Yuck.

1197
01:17:05,128 --> 01:17:07,086
What you're about to see
is top secret.

1198
01:17:08,043 --> 01:17:09,961
Do not tell my mother.

1199
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:12,210
Dead pigs, swine flu.

1200
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:13,210
- Not good.
- Now you know.

1201
01:17:13,419 --> 01:17:15,126
Next time, you eat
a goat or a pig.

1202
01:17:15,126 --> 01:17:16,376
There's a story
behind this.

1203
01:17:16,418 --> 01:17:17,751
Yeah,
there's a story.

1204
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:20,001
<i>...you're saying
you believe in aliens?</i>

1205
01:17:20,042 --> 01:17:21,375
Okay, files, files.

1206
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:23,167
We're talking about symbols.

1207
01:17:23,875 --> 01:17:26,249
Hey! Still radioactive.
Hands off.

1208
01:17:27,417 --> 01:17:28,790
Okay, Cube-brain.

1209
01:17:29,875 --> 01:17:31,915
Any of these look like
the symbols you saw?

1210
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:33,124
Where did you get these?

1211
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:35,165
Before I got fired.

1212
01:17:35,165 --> 01:17:37,707
I coached S-7's
scrawny, drooly...

1213
01:17:37,748 --> 01:17:42,788
75 years of alien research
which points to one inescapable fact:

1214
01:17:42,788 --> 01:17:47,414
The Transformers;
they've been here a long, long time.

1215
01:17:47,414 --> 01:17:48,079
How do I know?

1216
01:17:49,455 --> 01:17:51,455
Archaeologists found
these unexplained markings

1217
01:17:51,455 --> 01:17:53,913
and ancient runes
all over the world.

1218
01:17:54,247 --> 01:17:56,287
China, Egypt, Greece.

1219
01:17:57,078 --> 01:17:58,536
Shot at 1932.

1220
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:00,537
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1221
01:18:00,746 --> 01:18:03,035
- Yeah.
- Same ones over here, right?

1222
01:18:03,744 --> 01:18:07,868
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same thing?

1223
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:10,451
Aliens.

1224
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:12,410
And I think
some of them stayed.

1225
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:13,326
Check this out.

1226
01:18:13,493 --> 01:18:15,409
Project Black Knife.

1227
01:18:15,743 --> 01:18:19,451
Robots, in disguise.
Hiding here.

1228
01:18:19,743 --> 01:18:20,409
All along.

1229
01:18:20,451 --> 01:18:23,533
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1230
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:27,241
I pleaded on my knees
with S-7 to investigate it

1231
01:18:27,241 --> 01:18:30,865
but they said
the readings were infantesimal.

1232
01:18:30,865 --> 01:18:33,532
That I was obsessed!

1233
01:18:33,615 --> 01:18:35,156
Me, can you imagine that?

1234
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:38,574
Megatron said that there was
another Energon source here.

1235
01:18:38,615 --> 01:18:40,364
- On Earth? On another source?
- On Earth.

1236
01:18:40,573 --> 01:18:41,613
Okay,
and that these symbols,

1237
01:18:41,655 --> 01:18:43,196
the maps in my head
would lead him there.

1238
01:18:43,488 --> 01:18:45,239
Should you talk
to your Autobot friends?

1239
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:46,448
No, no, no,
the source is before.

1240
01:18:46,489 --> 01:18:49,113
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them. It's before them.

1241
01:18:49,404 --> 01:18:50,903
- So it comes before that.
- Correct.

1242
01:18:51,696 --> 01:18:52,821
Well then, report...

1243
01:18:53,113 --> 01:18:54,861
Unless we can talk
to a Decepticon.

1244
01:18:55,403 --> 01:18:57,528
I mean, I'm not on
speed terms or whatever...

1245
01:18:57,528 --> 01:18:59,028
Actually, I am.

1246
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:04,610
Let me out!

1247
01:19:05,445 --> 01:19:07,318
- It could be a little bit sad.
- Open it.

1248
01:19:09,193 --> 01:19:11,776
I'm gonna so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1249
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:12,901
Behave.

1250
01:19:12,901 --> 01:19:14,444
- What is it, a Decepticon?
- Yeah.

1251
01:19:14,694 --> 01:19:16,567
- Can you train him?
- Tried to.

1252
01:19:17,276 --> 01:19:19,984
I spent my whole adult life,
coming a plan of aliens.

1253
01:19:20,026 --> 01:19:21,526
- You're very furious--
- And you're carrying it around

1254
01:19:21,568 --> 01:19:23,316
what are you supposed to make
a little chihuahua.

1255
01:19:24,233 --> 01:19:26,358
Wanna throw it down,
you pubic fro-head?

1256
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:29,357
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye.

1257
01:19:29,815 --> 01:19:31,231
You know,
but if you're a good boy,

1258
01:19:31,481 --> 01:19:33,274
then I'm not gonna torch
your other eye.

1259
01:19:33,274 --> 01:19:34,607
Okay?
I'm not gonna torch it.

1260
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:36,647
Just tell me
what these symbols are.

1261
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:37,732
Please.

1262
01:19:39,314 --> 01:19:40,023
Okay.

1263
01:19:41,356 --> 01:19:44,314
Oh, I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1264
01:19:45,689 --> 01:19:47,688
I don't read it, but uh,
these guys...

1265
01:19:48,147 --> 01:19:50,896
Where the frick did you find
photos of these guys?

1266
01:19:51,147 --> 01:19:52,104
- Is this them?
- Yeah.

1267
01:19:52,146 --> 01:19:54,813
Sakers, pal.
Oldest of the old.

1268
01:19:54,938 --> 01:19:56,520
Oh, they've been here for
thousands of years,

1269
01:19:56,562 --> 01:19:57,770
looking for something.

1270
01:19:57,812 --> 01:19:59,603
I don't know what,
nobody tells me nothing.

1271
01:19:59,644 --> 01:20:01,812
Oh, they'll translate
those symbols for ya.

1272
01:20:01,977 --> 01:20:03,476
And I know
where to find them.

1273
01:20:03,518 --> 01:20:04,269
Show us.

1274
01:20:09,393 --> 01:20:11,227
Closest one's
in Washington.

1275
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:16,684
Smithsonian
Air and Space Museum.

1276
01:20:16,684 --> 01:20:19,018
Land of dreams
in there.

1277
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,559
All I ever want to be
was an astronaut.

1278
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,974
- Hold those.
- What is that?

1279
01:20:26,266 --> 01:20:26,891
What?

1280
01:20:26,891 --> 01:20:28,391
I wear them
when I'm in the funk.

1281
01:20:29,515 --> 01:20:32,557
So does Jeamby, Cheater.
It's a baseball thing.

1282
01:20:32,557 --> 01:20:35,638
Okay. Once you synchronize,
shop-mind and empty bladder

1283
01:20:35,638 --> 01:20:38,681
you get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1284
01:20:38,723 --> 01:20:39,722
Here, take one
of these pills.

1285
01:20:39,763 --> 01:20:40,472
Slip it
under your tongue,

1286
01:20:40,472 --> 01:20:42,930
it's a high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1287
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:44,763
Fools the polygraph,
everytime.

1288
01:20:44,805 --> 01:20:46,722
Okay, now let's get this show
on the road.

1289
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:49,137
Whoa, no, listen.
I can't do this.

1290
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,345
I'm not some
alien bounty hunter, alright?

1291
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:51,720
'cause I'm not gonna do this.
Guards have guns,

1292
01:20:51,761 --> 01:20:53,387
- I don't want to die.
- Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid.

1293
01:20:53,888 --> 01:20:56,511
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

1294
01:20:56,595 --> 01:20:59,760
Now look into my eyes,
and tighten up that spare tank.

1295
01:21:00,136 --> 01:21:01,803
<i>The museum
is now closing.</i>

1296
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:03,595
Papa, bad news, bro.

1297
01:21:03,636 --> 01:21:05,594
Ran out of toilet paper,
you got any out here?

1298
01:21:05,635 --> 01:21:07,801
- Please tell me you--
- Sir, I suggest you get in there.

1299
01:21:07,843 --> 01:21:09,301
The museum is closed.

1300
01:21:09,301 --> 01:21:11,967
Listen man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1301
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:13,801
Dumper-dumper.
I gotta go, alright?

1302
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:16,466
Sir, you are a grown naked man
around showing...

1303
01:21:16,758 --> 01:21:19,426
- Pull your pants up and exit--
- I'm not going anywhere.

1304
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:25,632
You got that paper,
right, sir?

1305
01:21:25,883 --> 01:21:26,966
You should be embarassed.

1306
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:28,674
This a family museum, sir.

1307
01:21:47,297 --> 01:21:48,921
What is going on here?

1308
01:21:48,963 --> 01:21:50,879
How many times
can you get tased in the nuts?

1309
01:21:50,879 --> 01:21:53,421
So you covered the gates,
huh, you know.

1310
01:21:53,462 --> 01:21:55,880
You're an amateur man,
a rank amateur.

1311
01:21:59,462 --> 01:22:01,378
There's now five guards.
Five guards.

1312
01:22:01,586 --> 01:22:03,043
- You get this stuff and get out of here.
- Give me a second.

1313
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,626
I gotta get
the tracker, alright.

1314
01:22:05,294 --> 01:22:07,544
- Be good.
- I'm claustrophobic.

1315
01:22:24,498 --> 01:22:26,708
Look, look.
Follow him, follow him.

1316
01:22:26,749 --> 01:22:27,541
He knows
where he's going.

1317
01:22:33,457 --> 01:22:34,665
- He knows something.
- What?

1318
01:22:34,707 --> 01:22:35,915
He knows something!

1319
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,371
- You got what I got?
- Yeah.

1320
01:22:43,371 --> 01:22:44,289
Blackbird.

1321
01:22:47,621 --> 01:22:49,121
There he is.

1322
01:22:49,163 --> 01:22:52,995
This guy's a legend,
like--like the Chairman of the Board.

1323
01:22:53,036 --> 01:22:54,787
Yo, freshman,
put the shard.

1324
01:22:55,245 --> 01:22:57,369
And watch
the magic happen.

1325
01:23:04,411 --> 01:23:06,493
Oh shit,
it's a Decepticon!

1326
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:08,536
- Decepticon?
- What is it?

1327
01:23:09,118 --> 01:23:10,492
Find the main tail!

1328
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:25,949
What sort of hideous
mosalleem is this?

1329
01:23:27,532 --> 01:23:30,781
Semi pulls and days,
show yourselves!

1330
01:23:30,781 --> 01:23:33,031
Or suffer my infinite wrath!

1331
01:23:34,448 --> 01:23:37,196
W-wait, old spinal called
based organisms.

1332
01:23:38,363 --> 01:23:39,239
Bugger!

1333
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:44,739
Behold the eternal glory
of Jetfire!

1334
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:46,904
Prepare
for a systems' override.

1335
01:23:46,904 --> 01:23:48,405
I tell you, this guy
did not age well.

1336
01:23:48,447 --> 01:23:51,279
- He either heard it.
- Command these doors to open.

1337
01:23:51,571 --> 01:23:52,571
Fire!

1338
01:23:52,821 --> 01:23:55,446
Oh, I said, fire!

1339
01:23:56,529 --> 01:23:57,819
Bollocks.

1340
01:23:57,819 --> 01:23:59,944
Break that,
these worthless--

1341
01:24:00,528 --> 01:24:01,319
Wait a second.

1342
01:24:01,694 --> 01:24:05,192
Itching, wretching,
rust in my arse.

1343
01:24:05,693 --> 01:24:08,527
Oh, the museum's gonna be
very angry.

1344
01:24:08,569 --> 01:24:10,859
Very angry.
We gotta catch that plane!

1345
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,067
I'm on a mission.

1346
01:24:16,735 --> 01:24:18,233
- W-wait, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1347
01:24:18,607 --> 01:24:19,233
- Hey!
- What do you want?

1348
01:24:19,275 --> 01:24:20,400
Look,
we just want to talk!

1349
01:24:20,442 --> 01:24:22,275
I've no time to talk,
I'm on a mission!

1350
01:24:22,317 --> 01:24:24,149
I'm a mercenary goon-bringer.

1351
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,232
- What planet am I on?
- Earth.

1352
01:24:26,274 --> 01:24:28,274
Earth?
Terrible name for a planet,

1353
01:24:28,316 --> 01:24:30,274
might as well
call it "dirt".

1354
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,231
Planet dirt.

1355
01:24:32,273 --> 01:24:35,189
Tell me, is that robot civil war
still going on?

1356
01:24:35,773 --> 01:24:37,316
- Who's winning?
- The Decepticons.

1357
01:24:38,355 --> 01:24:40,564
Well, I changed sides
to the Autobots.

1358
01:24:40,564 --> 01:24:41,980
What do you mean,
"changed sides"?

1359
01:24:42,022 --> 01:24:42,980
It's a choice.

1360
01:24:43,022 --> 01:24:47,354
It's intensely personal decision.
So much negativity.

1361
01:24:47,438 --> 01:24:49,478
Who wants to live a life
filled with hate?

1362
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,605
Meaning you don't have
to work for those

1363
01:24:50,605 --> 01:24:52,104
miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1364
01:24:52,145 --> 01:24:55,520
If they set on their way,
they destroy the whole Universe.

1365
01:24:55,979 --> 01:24:58,311
I'm changing sides,
I'm changing sides, Warrior Goddess!

1366
01:24:58,686 --> 01:25:00,978
- Who's your little Autobot?
- Oh you cutes.

1367
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:01,768
Name's Wheelie.

1368
01:25:02,394 --> 01:25:03,936
Say my name,
say my name!

1369
01:25:04,518 --> 01:25:06,226
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1370
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:07,476
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1371
01:25:07,518 --> 01:25:10,143
Yeah, well, he's faithful,
and he's nude and he's perverted.

1372
01:25:11,934 --> 01:25:13,184
Can you just--
Can you stop?

1373
01:25:13,226 --> 01:25:15,475
- Hey, what are you doing?
- ...I don't wanna argue it.

1374
01:25:15,517 --> 01:25:16,184
What were you saying?

1375
01:25:16,726 --> 01:25:18,933
I told you
my name was Jetfire!

1376
01:25:20,725 --> 01:25:22,683
Wow, someone shit in the bed
this morning?

1377
01:25:24,932 --> 01:25:26,473
Pretty stout
with my mother.

1378
01:25:26,599 --> 01:25:29,099
My ancestors have been here
for centuries.

1379
01:25:29,141 --> 01:25:31,973
My father, one was a wheel!
The first wheel!

1380
01:25:32,015 --> 01:25:34,014
- Do you know what he transformed into?
- No.

1381
01:25:34,264 --> 01:25:39,221
Nothing!
But he did so with honor, dignity and--

1382
01:25:47,304 --> 01:25:49,680
My boosters are fried.

1383
01:25:51,261 --> 01:25:52,761
I thought
we could help each other.

1384
01:25:52,761 --> 01:25:55,262
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know.

1385
01:25:55,262 --> 01:25:56,761
- I do.
- I don't think he knows anything.

1386
01:25:56,803 --> 01:25:57,929
Honestly, I don't know.

1387
01:26:01,595 --> 01:26:02,510
These vivid symbols,

1388
01:26:02,552 --> 01:26:04,219
they're symbols
but they are in my mind.

1389
01:26:04,261 --> 01:26:05,552
You see,
all this is in my mind.

1390
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:07,593
And Megatron
wants what's in my mind.

1391
01:26:07,593 --> 01:26:08,885
Him and someone called
the Fallen.

1392
01:26:08,885 --> 01:26:12,426
The Fallen? I know him.
He left me here to rust.

1393
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:13,843
The original Decepticon.

1394
01:26:13,885 --> 01:26:17,342
He's terrible to work for.
He's always apocalypse, chaos...

1395
01:26:18,132 --> 01:26:20,216
His suspects,
they were a part of my mission

1396
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:22,009
the Fall and Search,
I remember now.

1397
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:24,592
Of a dagger's tip
and the key!

1398
01:26:24,882 --> 01:26:26,715
Slow down.
The dagger's tip, the key,

1399
01:26:26,756 --> 01:26:28,174
- what are you talking about?
- No time to explain.

1400
01:26:28,174 --> 01:26:29,757
Hold on, everybody!

1401
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:59,085
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1402
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:00,961
I was overseeing
the wrong planet.

1403
01:27:01,003 --> 01:27:02,960
Hey, that frickin' hurt!

1404
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:05,460
Oh, my God!

1405
01:27:12,584 --> 01:27:14,624
Oh, God!

1406
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:22,125
Oh, my God! You beautiful face,
this will be a perfect moment.

1407
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:24,207
Except you landed
on my testicles.

1408
01:27:24,624 --> 01:27:26,040
Please get off!

1409
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:29,915
My balls!

1410
01:27:30,873 --> 01:27:32,456
Sam!

1411
01:27:33,372 --> 01:27:36,664
- Where are we? Simmons!
- Hey! Yeah!

1412
01:27:36,664 --> 01:27:37,789
Oh, my God.

1413
01:27:39,288 --> 01:27:41,621
What is this?
It's Vegas!

1414
01:27:41,663 --> 01:27:43,329
- You guys okay?
- Yeah!

1415
01:27:43,329 --> 01:27:46,246
Hey! I think
we're in Vegas!

1416
01:27:46,246 --> 01:27:47,746
That really, really hurts.

1417
01:27:47,787 --> 01:27:49,996
You're just lucky
that I didn't get hurt.

1418
01:27:49,996 --> 01:27:52,578
People could've gotten killed, okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,

1419
01:27:52,578 --> 01:27:54,746
- you would have heard from--
- Oh, shut up!

1420
01:27:54,787 --> 01:27:56,536
I told you
I was opening the space bridge.

1421
01:27:56,578 --> 01:27:58,829
It's the fastest way
to travel to Egypt.

1422
01:27:58,829 --> 01:28:01,327
What did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything!

1423
01:28:01,744 --> 01:28:03,910
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1424
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:06,577
Don't you dare
slip in with me, fleshwing.

1425
01:28:07,117 --> 01:28:09,493
- You would do the informed.
- Can you just stop for a second?

1426
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:11,451
Can you focus?
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1427
01:28:11,492 --> 01:28:14,159
so we can all have a little bit
assemblance and peace of mind?

1428
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,451
This planet was visited
by our race once before

1429
01:28:17,451 --> 01:28:20,365
by our earliest ancestors
a millenium ago.

1430
01:28:20,407 --> 01:28:23,407
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1431
01:28:23,407 --> 01:28:26,032
the life blood
of our race.

1432
01:28:26,032 --> 01:28:28,990
Without it, we'll all perish,
oxidize and rust,

1433
01:28:30,991 --> 01:28:35,196
Do you have any idea what is
like a slowly fall of parton die?

1434
01:28:35,238 --> 01:28:38,072
Let's not get episodic, okay?
Old-timer.

1435
01:28:38,531 --> 01:28:43,946
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts, details, condense, plot, tell it.

1436
01:28:43,946 --> 01:28:48,945
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1437
01:28:49,112 --> 01:28:53,194
It harvests Energon
by destroying suns.

1438
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,070
- Destroy suns?
- You mean blow them up?

1439
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:58,737
Yes. You see, in the beginning,
there were seven Primes,

1440
01:28:58,778 --> 01:29:00,402
our original leaders.

1441
01:29:00,485 --> 01:29:04,444
And they set out in the Universe
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1442
01:29:05,027 --> 01:29:07,319
The Primes set out
with one rule:

1443
01:29:07,319 --> 01:29:10,484
Never destroy a planet
with life.

1444
01:29:10,484 --> 01:29:13,567
Until one of them
tried to defy this rule.

1445
01:29:13,608 --> 01:29:17,817
And his name, for ever more,
was the Fallen.

1446
01:29:19,523 --> 01:29:21,858
He despised
the human race.

1447
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:27,107
And he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

1448
01:29:27,107 --> 01:29:31,524
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

1449
01:29:31,524 --> 01:29:34,647
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1450
01:29:40,938 --> 01:29:45,396
A great battle took place
over possession of the Matrix.

1451
01:29:49,812 --> 01:29:52,395
The Fallen who was
stronger at his will did,

1452
01:29:53,519 --> 01:29:58,519
surrendered no choice,
but to steal and hide it from him.

1453
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:03,851
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

1454
01:30:03,892 --> 01:30:07,184
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies.

1455
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:10,767
A tomb
we cannot find.

1456
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:15,017
Somewhere,
buried in this desert,

1457
01:30:15,017 --> 01:30:17,641
that deadly machine
remains.

1458
01:30:17,683 --> 01:30:19,851
The Fallen knows
where it is.

1459
01:30:19,893 --> 01:30:25,765
And if he finds the Tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1460
01:30:26,016 --> 01:30:27,515
Okay so how do we stop it?

1461
01:30:27,557 --> 01:30:29,723
Only a Prime
can defeat the Fallen.

1462
01:30:30,265 --> 01:30:31,307
Optimus Prime?

1463
01:30:34,139 --> 01:30:36,221
So you met a Prime?

1464
01:30:36,847 --> 01:30:39,389
You must have met
a great descendant.

1465
01:30:39,431 --> 01:30:40,345
Is he alive?

1466
01:30:40,596 --> 01:30:42,929
Here?
On this planet?

1467
01:30:43,221 --> 01:30:45,470
He sacrificed himself
to save me.

1468
01:30:46,221 --> 01:30:47,470
So he's dead.

1469
01:30:47,637 --> 01:30:49,511
Without a Prime,
it's impossible.

1470
01:30:49,803 --> 01:30:51,929
No one else
could stop the Fallen.

1471
01:30:51,971 --> 01:30:55,094
So the same energy that's going
to be used to reactivate the machine...

1472
01:30:55,845 --> 01:30:58,803
Could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1473
01:30:58,845 --> 01:30:59,803
and bring him
back to life?

1474
01:30:59,845 --> 01:31:01,843
It was never designed
for that purpose,

1475
01:31:01,885 --> 01:31:04,593
but it's an energy,
like no other.

1476
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:08,717
So then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1477
01:31:08,758 --> 01:31:12,051
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols,

1478
01:31:12,093 --> 01:31:14,675
what you got in the sand,
it's your bloom.

1479
01:31:14,675 --> 01:31:16,966
When dawn alights
the Dagger's tip,

1480
01:31:17,008 --> 01:31:19,800
three kings will reveal
the doorway.

1481
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,923
Find the doorway!

1482
01:31:21,965 --> 01:31:23,465
Go now, go!

1483
01:31:23,716 --> 01:31:26,716
That was my mission.
It's your mission now.

1484
01:31:26,716 --> 01:31:29,256
Go before
the Decepticons find me

1485
01:31:29,339 --> 01:31:31,256
and find you.

1486
01:31:37,589 --> 01:31:38,964
That was
my CIA contact.

1487
01:31:39,006 --> 01:31:41,421
Says Ancient Sumerian used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba

1488
01:31:41,463 --> 01:31:43,671
- the Dagger's Tip.
- That's the dagger's tip.

1489
01:31:43,713 --> 01:31:44,837
- It's part of the Red Sea.
- Got it.

1490
01:31:44,879 --> 01:31:47,088
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1491
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:49,795
29 and a half degrees north.
35 east.

1492
01:31:50,211 --> 01:31:51,004
There it is.

1493
01:31:51,212 --> 01:31:53,420
Okay, first thing we gotta do
is get Optimus to Dagger's Tip.

1494
01:31:53,462 --> 01:31:55,044
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1495
01:31:55,836 --> 01:31:56,751
We're gonna make a call.

1496
01:32:00,086 --> 01:32:01,001
We got the cops.

1497
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,125
I can't go to prison, guys!

1498
01:32:12,585 --> 01:32:15,250
Sam, you gotta get off
this road and lay low.

1499
01:32:25,832 --> 01:32:27,748
Man, they'll pick up.

1500
01:32:27,789 --> 01:32:30,039
This is just called
blending in like a ninja.

1501
01:32:30,206 --> 01:32:31,914
How about I'll lay my piss
in your face?

1502
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:33,664
They're gone.

1503
01:32:34,413 --> 01:32:35,372
Wait another time.

1504
01:32:35,581 --> 01:32:36,706
How are you gonna make
the call to Lennox?

1505
01:32:36,748 --> 01:32:39,205
You are in the worldwide. What,
they're gonna tranquil in one base?

1506
01:32:39,247 --> 01:32:40,664
They'll track you here
in seconds.

1507
01:32:40,664 --> 01:32:42,620
CIA is all over this place.

1508
01:32:42,662 --> 01:32:43,621
You're gonna call?

1509
01:32:48,912 --> 01:32:50,870
Okay,
that's--that's a good idea.

1510
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:52,537
- Alright?
- I mean I just was...

1511
01:32:52,996 --> 01:32:54,078
My mind in other things.

1512
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:55,745
Like why don't you get
being chipped in prison.

1513
01:32:56,619 --> 01:32:57,952
New Jersey

1514
01:32:57,994 --> 01:33:00,619
<i>This departure:
2100 hours.</i>

1515
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,535
So we're shipped in
back to base.

1516
01:33:04,326 --> 01:33:05,784
This is central at stake.

1517
01:33:11,159 --> 01:33:13,408
Major Lennox, phone call.

1518
01:33:14,117 --> 01:33:16,033
Lennox, I'm with the kid.
The kid, you know?

1519
01:33:16,283 --> 01:33:17,323
One with the attitude break?

1520
01:33:17,323 --> 01:33:18,866
I need the truck.
The truck.

1521
01:33:18,907 --> 01:33:21,614
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1522
01:33:21,656 --> 01:33:22,781
You're not gonna believe
where we are.

1523
01:33:22,781 --> 01:33:25,906
Code Tot,
as in King Tutankhamen,

1524
01:33:25,948 --> 01:33:27,615
back of a $1 bill.

1525
01:33:28,031 --> 01:33:32,865
Coordinates for air-drop,
29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1526
01:33:32,906 --> 01:33:34,156
Get it.
Write it down, write it.

1527
01:33:34,573 --> 01:33:35,530
Oh, my God.

1528
01:33:35,572 --> 01:33:37,072
I gotta go, okay.
I hate the cops.

1529
01:33:37,072 --> 01:33:38,280
W-Wait, who are you?

1530
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:42,404
Wait, it's me.
Leo, me, Leo, Leo. Leo.

1531
01:33:42,487 --> 01:33:43,821
The cops are coming right now.
We need to go.

1532
01:33:46,903 --> 01:33:50,445
Coordinates
29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1533
01:33:50,445 --> 01:33:52,862
Tip of the Red Sea,
Gulf of Aqaba.

1534
01:33:53,321 --> 01:33:54,194
Egypt.

1535
01:33:54,862 --> 01:33:55,944
Are you serious?

1536
01:33:57,403 --> 01:33:57,985
Sir.

1537
01:34:02,776 --> 01:34:05,569
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there.

1538
01:34:05,569 --> 01:34:08,193
How is this little kid's
supposed to bring him back to life?

1539
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:09,941
I don't know.

1540
01:34:10,525 --> 01:34:11,942
But we gotta trust him.

1541
01:34:13,941 --> 01:34:15,357
Okay, let's go
over it again.

1542
01:34:15,357 --> 01:34:17,815
- When the dawn arise...
- When the dawn arise the dagger's tip,

1543
01:34:17,857 --> 01:34:19,941
- the three kings...
- ...will reveal the doorway.

1544
01:34:19,983 --> 01:34:21,692
That's what he said.
You know what that means?

1545
01:34:21,897 --> 01:34:23,607
- No, what does it mean?
- I have no idea.

1546
01:34:23,607 --> 01:34:25,482
Oh my God, oh my God.
Checkpoint, checkpoint.

1547
01:34:25,524 --> 01:34:26,565
I don't have
my passport.

1548
01:34:28,856 --> 01:34:33,356
Passport.
Idiota (Idiot)!

1549
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:39,022
They have cams at top.

1550
01:34:41,188 --> 01:34:42,937
He's the one
that they want.

1551
01:34:43,687 --> 01:34:45,771
Alright, chill.
Let's be nice to them.

1552
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:48,062
I can handle it.
These are my people.

1553
01:34:48,187 --> 01:34:50,102
- Yeah.
- I'm 136.

1554
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:54,227
Oh great, a frickin' munchkin.

1555
01:34:54,269 --> 01:34:56,644
Oh, little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

1556
01:35:01,895 --> 01:35:05,685
- What do you want?
- I want to go to...

1557
01:35:05,768 --> 01:35:08,602
The Dagger's Tip, right?

1558
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:11,225
Egypt, Jordan.
We wanna go there.

1559
01:35:11,225 --> 01:35:13,267
Me and my family.
This is my family.

1560
01:35:13,267 --> 01:35:15,309
- This is my son, my other son.
- Hi there.

1561
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:16,057
My daughter.

1562
01:35:16,182 --> 01:35:18,348
We're tourists
from New York.

1563
01:35:18,473 --> 01:35:20,057
- New York?
- Yes. Yes.

1564
01:35:20,433 --> 01:35:21,516
50 kilometres.

1565
01:35:21,558 --> 01:35:22,973
We're going to get one
of your falafels, thank you!

1566
01:35:23,015 --> 01:35:23,931
Yeah,
thank you very much.

1567
01:35:23,973 --> 01:35:25,974
- New York.
- I know, I know you from somewhere.

1568
01:35:26,472 --> 01:35:28,015
No, we do not work
for the CIA.

1569
01:35:32,472 --> 01:35:36,013
<i>Decepticons,
voice location.</i>

1570
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:37,179
<i>Detected.</i>

1571
01:35:38,512 --> 01:35:41,680
Starscream in pursuit.

1572
01:35:46,013 --> 01:35:49,013
Undercover, yo, you gotta blend in
with your surrounding.

1573
01:35:49,013 --> 01:35:51,261
You know, you gotta be
part of the landscape.

1574
01:35:59,552 --> 01:36:00,260
Awesome.

1575
01:36:01,343 --> 01:36:02,550
I think
aliens built that.

1576
01:36:03,176 --> 01:36:04,426
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1577
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:06,093
Go, move it!
Move it.

1578
01:36:06,842 --> 01:36:07,593
- What?
- Hey, guard us.

1579
01:36:07,801 --> 01:36:09,135
Low-profile,
don't make a scene, okay?

1580
01:36:09,177 --> 01:36:10,591
Yeah, some of us
got work to do!

1581
01:36:10,924 --> 01:36:12,175
Dumb Autobots.

1582
01:36:15,633 --> 01:36:18,798
Estimated time of detachment
NEST, 0600 AM

1583
01:36:33,589 --> 01:36:35,630
Being my girlfriend
is hazardous to your health.

1584
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:41,796
Yeah, well,
girls like dangerous boys.

1585
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:43,587
- Really?
- Yeah.

1586
01:36:46,463 --> 01:36:48,087
Why don't you say it?

1587
01:36:48,837 --> 01:36:49,919
Ladies first.

1588
01:36:51,627 --> 01:36:53,961
Okay, so tonight,
you're gonna be a gentleman.

1589
01:36:54,462 --> 01:36:55,836
You're really chivalrous.

1590
01:36:56,211 --> 01:36:57,169
Why are you mad at me?

1591
01:36:57,751 --> 01:36:59,793
You know what?
Baby, I'm not...

1592
01:37:00,169 --> 01:37:01,668
I'm not mad.

1593
01:37:02,335 --> 01:37:06,752
You realise that I just flew 3,000 miles
to keep you from getting killed.

1594
01:37:06,877 --> 01:37:07,709
I know.

1595
01:37:11,332 --> 01:37:13,208
Who else could be
your girlfriend too?

1596
01:37:14,167 --> 01:37:16,208
Look at the things
that go through with me.

1597
01:37:17,458 --> 01:37:19,874
And now we're underneath
the moon and the stars

1598
01:37:19,915 --> 01:37:22,207
and the three most beautiful
pyramids on the planet

1599
01:37:22,249 --> 01:37:24,290
and you still can't even tell me
that you love me.

1600
01:37:27,998 --> 01:37:28,956
- What?
- Wait.

1601
01:37:28,998 --> 01:37:31,580
- Why do boys always change the subject?
- The moon and the stars...

1602
01:37:31,621 --> 01:37:33,414
- Sam...
- Come with me really quick.

1603
01:37:41,246 --> 01:37:43,327
Simmons, Leo,
wake up!

1604
01:37:46,662 --> 01:37:48,911
Listen, Astronomy class, page 47,
you remember the class?

1605
01:37:48,911 --> 01:37:51,535
No, no, I was only in college
for two days, you remember that?

1606
01:37:51,577 --> 01:37:53,536
- Yeah, well, get up. Up, up.
- What are you talking about?

1607
01:37:59,202 --> 01:38:00,285
Can you see
those three stars?

1608
01:38:00,326 --> 01:38:02,036
You see how the last one
touches the horizon?

1609
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,411
That's Orion's belt.

1610
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:05,993
It's also called the Three Kings
and the reason for that is

1611
01:38:06,035 --> 01:38:08,784
the three Egyptian kings who built
the pyramids in Giza built them

1612
01:38:08,784 --> 01:38:09,951
to mear those stars.

1613
01:38:09,993 --> 01:38:11,782
So it's like an aerial staring
straight in the face.

1614
01:38:11,782 --> 01:38:13,575
They all point due east
towards Jordan.

1615
01:38:13,908 --> 01:38:15,242
The mountains of Petra.

1616
01:38:28,406 --> 01:38:32,447
<i>We got a seatbelt malfunction.
We gotta have to divert...</i>

1617
01:38:32,447 --> 01:38:34,072
<i>Flight in lower,
prepare for bail-out.</i>

1618
01:38:34,197 --> 01:38:36,405
Bail-out, bail-out,
bail-out, bail-out?

1619
01:38:36,447 --> 01:38:38,612
Alright, team,
grab your shoots.

1620
01:38:38,654 --> 01:38:39,405
Bail-out?

1621
01:38:41,946 --> 01:38:43,613
Familiar with the standard
MC-4?

1622
01:38:43,819 --> 01:38:46,653
Of course not. I've never jumped out
of a publicly good airplane before.

1623
01:38:46,862 --> 01:38:48,236
Wait a minute,
is this really happening?

1624
01:38:48,236 --> 01:38:48,653
Yeah.

1625
01:38:51,278 --> 01:38:52,777
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1626
01:38:53,235 --> 01:38:54,652
You're behind this,
aren't you?

1627
01:38:54,861 --> 01:38:55,818
What are you talking about?

1628
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,943
You heard the pilot.
These guys don't mess around.

1629
01:38:59,152 --> 01:39:02,152
This is standard procedure.
I'm just following orders to the letter.

1630
01:39:02,193 --> 01:39:03,402
Do you know
what you said?

1631
01:39:04,442 --> 01:39:06,817
You, just find the captain
and your career--

1632
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:13,608
Wait, what was that?
What's that?

1633
01:39:13,774 --> 01:39:14,816
That's not good.

1634
01:39:15,317 --> 01:39:17,607
Come on.
Right this way, right this way!

1635
01:39:17,648 --> 01:39:18,357
I can't jump
out of an airplane.

1636
01:39:23,774 --> 01:39:26,023
Come here.
Come here.

1637
01:39:27,231 --> 01:39:30,064
Because I have to secure
the VIPs first.

1638
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:32,396
Okay, I want you
to listen very carefully.

1639
01:39:32,396 --> 01:39:34,230
Remember as everything
that I say.

1640
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:37,687
East to the GPS trackers, so
you can be found by search and rescue.

1641
01:39:41,937 --> 01:39:43,313
- Look, are you listening?
- I can't.

1642
01:39:44,603 --> 01:39:46,270
- Alright, alright.
- Alright.

1643
01:39:46,353 --> 01:39:48,187
When the plane that shoot
inflates into the air,

1644
01:39:48,187 --> 01:39:50,312
pull the pin
and open some air,

1645
01:39:50,353 --> 01:39:52,560
break your rack up,
lose your primary.

1646
01:39:52,768 --> 01:39:54,060
I want you
to pull the blue.

1647
01:39:54,185 --> 01:39:55,936
I need you to pull it
really hard.

1648
01:39:56,727 --> 01:39:59,310
Not right now.
We're on the plane, you dumbass!

1649
01:40:02,602 --> 01:40:03,685
Did he say goodbye?

1650
01:40:03,727 --> 01:40:05,434
No, he didn't even
say goodbye.

1651
01:40:05,975 --> 01:40:07,601
<i>General,
we're loaded and ready.</i>

1652
01:40:07,851 --> 01:40:10,684
<i>You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.</i>

1653
01:40:10,934 --> 01:40:11,975
- Excellent.
- Sir,

1654
01:40:11,975 --> 01:40:13,765
you need to see this.
Now.

1655
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:18,015
Have we checked
these coordinates?

1656
01:40:18,056 --> 01:40:19,473
Egypt, sir.
They're air-dropping in.

1657
01:40:19,473 --> 01:40:20,764
You gotta be kidding me.

1658
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:22,557
He knows something.

1659
01:40:22,682 --> 01:40:25,556
We need to be ready to back him up,
if this thing goes hot.

1660
01:40:26,431 --> 01:40:27,180
Copy that.

1661
01:40:27,681 --> 01:40:29,848
CIA just got a hit
on the boy.

1662
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:32,971
Hundred miles from the location
on that little map there.

1663
01:40:32,971 --> 01:40:33,763
It's getting hotter.

1664
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:40,887
It's gotta be...
around here somewhere.

1665
01:41:21,548 --> 01:41:22,798
It's here somewhere,
guys.

1666
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:23,798
Oh yeah, why?

1667
01:41:24,090 --> 01:41:25,839
'Cause we're trusting
Grandpa Blackbird

1668
01:41:25,881 --> 01:41:27,256
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on.

1669
01:41:27,298 --> 01:41:29,797
On his defense,
this is the biggest doorway

1670
01:41:29,839 --> 01:41:31,506
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

1671
01:41:32,213 --> 01:41:34,921
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, alright?

1672
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:36,297
Nope.

1673
01:41:36,422 --> 01:41:39,045
Ever questioned mind, guys, that
archaeologists have been here before.

1674
01:41:39,087 --> 01:41:40,004
There's nothing here.

1675
01:41:40,045 --> 01:41:42,379
You realise it's heart-break,
despair, kid.

1676
01:41:42,587 --> 01:41:44,754
Sometimes, you get
to the end of the rainbow

1677
01:41:44,796 --> 01:41:46,961
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it.

1678
01:41:46,961 --> 01:41:48,670
I'm listening to you;
you live with your mother.

1679
01:41:50,378 --> 01:41:52,753
- It's not over.
- It is over. It's done.

1680
01:41:52,794 --> 01:41:54,419
Why are we still listening
to your little punk-ass?

1681
01:41:54,461 --> 01:41:56,544
I mean, what kind of dumbfucks
accept ding my rim?

1682
01:41:56,586 --> 01:41:58,584
Kill Megatron.
How about that?

1683
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:00,251
Well, he doesn't get the job done,
you know, I mean,

1684
01:42:00,251 --> 01:42:02,168
- 'cause he's zapped, man.
- You scared?

1685
01:42:02,168 --> 01:42:04,042
Well, scared?
Scared of your ugly face.

1686
01:42:04,334 --> 01:42:06,916
I'm ugly?
Well, we twins, you stupid genius.

1687
01:42:13,915 --> 01:42:15,750
Guys!
Oh, hey!

1688
01:42:16,374 --> 01:42:17,498
You like
the way that feels?

1689
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:19,165
- That ain't hurt.
- You got that, don't you?

1690
01:42:19,165 --> 01:42:19,957
I'm getting up--

1691
01:42:28,998 --> 01:42:30,164
Now that's rude.

1692
01:42:41,536 --> 01:42:43,829
Oh, my God!
The symbols.

1693
01:42:44,954 --> 01:42:46,578
Bee!
Shoot it.

1694
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:17,658
Wow!

1695
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:19,448
This is the part
which they found silicon.

1696
01:43:20,698 --> 01:43:22,281
The Tomb of the Primes.

1697
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:41,779
The Matrix.

1698
01:44:05,943 --> 01:44:08,233
Thousands of years
turned to dust.

1699
01:44:08,941 --> 01:44:10,566
This isn't how
it's supposed to end.

1700
01:44:11,233 --> 01:44:12,150
Hear that?

1701
01:44:16,649 --> 01:44:19,399
US Air Force. C-17s.

1702
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:23,189
You can't bring it back, Sam,
there's nothing left.

1703
01:44:23,481 --> 01:44:25,440
Look, look around you.

1704
01:44:25,690 --> 01:44:28,355
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all.

1705
01:44:28,397 --> 01:44:29,814
They just haven't
end like this.

1706
01:44:29,814 --> 01:44:31,647
There is a reason
that we're here.

1707
01:44:31,688 --> 01:44:34,105
The voices and the symbols
in my head led us here...

1708
01:44:34,105 --> 01:44:35,313
for a purpose.

1709
01:44:41,228 --> 01:44:43,312
Everyone's after me
because of what I know.

1710
01:44:45,604 --> 01:44:48,686
And what I know,
is that this is going to work.

1711
01:44:49,352 --> 01:44:51,019
How do you know
it's going to work?

1712
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:52,561
Because I believe it.

1713
01:45:03,058 --> 01:45:05,101
Best put me out
of this plane.

1714
01:45:15,724 --> 01:45:18,474
He's dropping the big one.
Sam!

1715
01:45:26,056 --> 01:45:28,180
You think you can bring him
back to life with that pixie dust?

1716
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:29,930
Absolutely.
Let's go!

1717
01:45:39,762 --> 01:45:40,428
Go!

1718
01:45:42,095 --> 01:45:42,721
Move it!

1719
01:45:43,428 --> 01:45:44,761
Remember your friendly!

1720
01:45:55,176 --> 01:45:56,342
Cover Optimus!

1721
01:45:59,634 --> 01:46:01,676
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1722
01:46:01,676 --> 01:46:03,758
Get snipers and Stingers
up high.

1723
01:46:04,259 --> 01:46:06,551
So he just dropped off
ten tonnes of dead robot

1724
01:46:06,551 --> 01:46:07,591
in the middle of nowhere.

1725
01:46:08,175 --> 01:46:09,966
Hope this little kid
know what he's doing.

1726
01:46:10,008 --> 01:46:10,967
Yeah, me too.

1727
01:46:16,965 --> 01:46:20,340
Got a visual!
Yellow tee, four klicks.

1728
01:46:23,505 --> 01:46:24,630
Hot-flare!

1729
01:46:27,212 --> 01:46:29,005
That's them right there.
You see the flare?

1730
01:46:29,046 --> 01:46:30,088
Right over there!
See it?

1731
01:46:31,421 --> 01:46:33,464
The boy has been found.

1732
01:46:40,919 --> 01:46:41,754
Sam!

1733
01:46:54,293 --> 01:46:55,792
Oh God, please God,

1734
01:46:55,834 --> 01:46:56,959
- please!
- Leo, stop freaking out.

1735
01:46:57,001 --> 01:46:59,294
- Just stop freaking out!
- Just drop this guy off, huh?

1736
01:46:59,335 --> 01:47:00,958
- Please let me live, just let me live.
- Stop freaking out!

1737
01:47:01,292 --> 01:47:02,834
Just stop screaming
right now. That's it.

1738
01:47:05,459 --> 01:47:07,376
Can't take that guy
anymore.

1739
01:47:29,913 --> 01:47:30,538
We gotta split up.

1740
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:33,455
Bumblebee, you are the decoy.
You lead the Decepticons away, alright?

1741
01:47:33,788 --> 01:47:34,829
I'm gonna get Optimus.

1742
01:47:34,829 --> 01:47:36,871
I'll help throw their fire away.

1743
01:47:37,245 --> 01:47:38,746
You get to those soldiers.

1744
01:47:40,495 --> 01:47:41,953
I hope
that dust works, kid.

1745
01:47:42,412 --> 01:47:43,328
Thank you.

1746
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,326
It's turning around.

1747
01:47:49,285 --> 01:47:50,660
It's coming back,
it's coming back.

1748
01:47:51,619 --> 01:47:52,660
It's up to me.

1749
01:47:52,827 --> 01:47:55,744
One man, alone, betrayed
by the country he loves,

1750
01:47:55,785 --> 01:47:58,243
now its last hope
in the final hour of need.

1751
01:47:58,243 --> 01:48:00,826
The pants are to be driven
like never before.

1752
01:48:00,826 --> 01:48:01,950
Under my skin.

1753
01:48:02,117 --> 01:48:03,949
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't go nowhere.

1754
01:48:03,991 --> 01:48:06,034
- Drive!
- You will never make it, kid.

1755
01:48:06,075 --> 01:48:07,701
Bravery will only get you
so far.

1756
01:48:07,743 --> 01:48:10,366
You tased me, okay?
You owe me.

1757
01:48:10,408 --> 01:48:11,408
- I'm go.
- Okay, okay.

1758
01:48:11,616 --> 01:48:12,907
That was a test.
You passed, alright?

1759
01:48:20,614 --> 01:48:22,822
Thing's got alien tattoos
all over.

1760
01:48:23,239 --> 01:48:24,488
That ain't Air Force.

1761
01:48:28,195 --> 01:48:29,571
What the hell was that?

1762
01:48:29,612 --> 01:48:31,363
- Eddy-1, copy.
- Anyone there?

1763
01:48:31,405 --> 01:48:32,072
Who's up?

1764
01:48:32,114 --> 01:48:33,529
- Copy.
- Radio's down.

1765
01:48:33,571 --> 01:48:34,987
It's dead.
Counter that.

1766
01:48:35,029 --> 01:48:36,071
EMP-burst.

1767
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:39,696
Let's see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1768
01:48:41,694 --> 01:48:42,486
Yes, sir.

1769
01:48:42,528 --> 01:48:44,694
<i>Major Lennox told me
to pull the cord.</i>

1770
01:48:44,694 --> 01:48:45,278
I know, sir.

1771
01:48:45,445 --> 01:48:47,987
W-Which, what country
am I in right now?

1772
01:48:47,987 --> 01:48:49,319
United States.

1773
01:48:49,818 --> 01:48:53,527
No, no, not the United States.
I'm from the United States,

1774
01:48:53,569 --> 01:48:55,651
<i>I'm in the middle of nowhere,
surrounded by goats.</i>

1775
01:48:56,442 --> 01:48:59,109
Well, that was
our good friend, Galloway.

1776
01:48:59,109 --> 01:49:00,984
He's less than pleased.

1777
01:49:01,318 --> 01:49:03,942
How is it that
we can't reach our men,

1778
01:49:03,984 --> 01:49:09,733
but he can reach me
from some random Egyptian desert?

1779
01:49:13,524 --> 01:49:14,149
Nothing.

1780
01:49:14,983 --> 01:49:18,064
Mike, put an SOS, let the eye in the sky
know we need some help.

1781
01:49:18,064 --> 01:49:18,732
Yes, sir.

1782
01:49:20,689 --> 01:49:23,106
Pop some more flares
so that the kid can find us.

1783
01:49:30,229 --> 01:49:32,397
There he is.
We got a couple of miles.

1784
01:49:32,812 --> 01:49:37,312
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1785
01:49:37,353 --> 01:49:43,312
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1786
01:49:43,312 --> 01:49:45,686
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1787
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,436
Our satellites in the area
have gone blind.

1788
01:49:47,436 --> 01:49:48,437
We're working it, sir.

1789
01:49:48,562 --> 01:49:49,602
Dammit.

1790
01:49:49,768 --> 01:49:52,352
Something's not right,
it doesn't add up.

1791
01:49:52,352 --> 01:49:55,684
Contact the Jordanians, see what
their assets they've got in the area.

1792
01:49:55,684 --> 01:49:58,059
And get Egypt's
General Salaam,

1793
01:49:58,101 --> 01:50:02,182
ask him to clear some US
V over-flights in Egyptian airspace.

1794
01:50:02,224 --> 01:50:05,224
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1795
01:50:05,474 --> 01:50:06,892
Scramble predators now.

1796
01:50:07,225 --> 01:50:08,684
B-1, rotate.

1797
01:50:20,599 --> 01:50:21,764
East on the mile
that way.

1798
01:50:28,181 --> 01:50:28,764
Come here.

1799
01:50:32,346 --> 01:50:33,179
This way.

1800
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:42,179
- One man... alone...
- Stop saying that.

1801
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:44,136
- betrayed by the country he loves.
- Oh my goodness,

1802
01:50:44,136 --> 01:50:46,052
I'm in the car, okay?
You're not alone.

1803
01:50:46,469 --> 01:50:48,261
Just relax,
you're looking nice well.

1804
01:50:57,467 --> 01:50:59,092
I-I don't think
he's still following us.

1805
01:51:00,551 --> 01:51:01,717
That's what you think.

1806
01:51:19,256 --> 01:51:22,921
Master, sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

1807
01:51:22,921 --> 01:51:25,921
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1808
01:51:26,213 --> 01:51:28,505
The boy must have
the Matrix.

1809
01:51:28,881 --> 01:51:31,463
We cannot let him
reach Optimus.

1810
01:51:32,005 --> 01:51:33,837
Decepticons!

1811
01:51:34,004 --> 01:51:35,796
Begin our assault!

1812
01:51:36,670 --> 01:51:38,044
We got incoming!

1813
01:51:54,293 --> 01:51:56,459
We got a whole load of
flight coming our way!

1814
01:51:57,251 --> 01:51:59,125
- How many?
- We got 13 to count.

1815
01:51:59,584 --> 01:52:02,167
This ain't good.
This ain't good.

1816
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:12,498
We 'bout to get
our asses whooped.

1817
01:52:15,331 --> 01:52:18,039
Alright, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1818
01:52:19,706 --> 01:52:22,581
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life.

1819
01:52:22,581 --> 01:52:25,706
So our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1820
01:52:25,789 --> 01:52:27,621
Alright, we're gonna draw
fire from the left flag.

1821
01:52:27,663 --> 01:52:28,663
I need a scout team.

1822
01:52:29,539 --> 01:52:31,579
We'll walk through the middle
with Arcee and Ironhide.

1823
01:52:32,163 --> 01:52:33,705
Alright, when you see
the precious cargo,

1824
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:36,661
I want you to pop green smoke
and come back to those pillars.

1825
01:52:36,703 --> 01:52:37,912
We'll have
the ambush set.

1826
01:52:38,286 --> 01:52:39,661
Alright, let's go,
move out!

1827
01:52:39,661 --> 01:52:40,287
- Move out!
- Move out!

1828
01:52:49,077 --> 01:52:51,243
Did you see that film
Gunfire Aero-Kay Karao?

1829
01:52:53,285 --> 01:52:56,410
- Casting Kirk Douglas.
- No, why?

1830
01:52:59,451 --> 01:53:00,867
Looks like we're right
in the middle of it.

1831
01:53:01,326 --> 01:53:02,118
Is that good?

1832
01:53:04,616 --> 01:53:05,950
Lot of people died.

1833
01:53:22,488 --> 01:53:25,113
- Oh, oh, oh...
- Hide!

1834
01:53:27,447 --> 01:53:28,572
Oh my God!

1835
01:53:50,734 --> 01:53:51,818
Sam, Sam.

1836
01:53:55,735 --> 01:53:56,693
Get down, get down.

1837
01:54:01,358 --> 01:54:02,649
Once, it's clear,
we'll run for Optimus

1838
01:54:02,691 --> 01:54:04,065
as fast we can, okay?

1839
01:54:05,899 --> 01:54:07,107
And what if
it doesn't work?

1840
01:54:08,232 --> 01:54:09,150
This will work.

1841
01:54:09,774 --> 01:54:11,607
- Yeah, but what if it doesn't?
- It's gonna work.

1842
01:54:12,231 --> 01:54:13,149
It'll work.

1843
01:56:00,883 --> 01:56:01,925
Radio shell.

1844
01:56:21,297 --> 01:56:22,505
We got a half a mile.

1845
01:56:22,672 --> 01:56:24,130
I don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1846
01:56:26,921 --> 01:56:27,589
Fall back!

1847
01:56:28,212 --> 01:56:29,755
Ironhide, up for middle.

1848
01:56:30,088 --> 01:56:31,255
Ironhide, move it.

1849
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:34,045
Go!
Go, go!

1850
01:56:45,376 --> 01:56:46,877
There's no way to go.
We're gonna die!

1851
01:56:46,877 --> 01:56:49,251
Listen, we're going out.
We're going out like men, understand?

1852
01:57:18,913 --> 01:57:21,039
- Oh.
- Look at this motherf--

1853
01:57:21,621 --> 01:57:23,622
Mean robots suck!

1854
01:57:36,204 --> 01:57:36,995
Get back!

1855
01:57:41,994 --> 01:57:43,411
Grab it!
Don't let go.

1856
01:57:43,578 --> 01:57:45,036
Hang in, man,
I got this.

1857
01:57:50,035 --> 01:57:51,201
I don't wanna die.

1858
01:57:53,451 --> 01:57:55,409
Careful grip, boy.
Careful grip.

1859
01:58:01,033 --> 01:58:03,575
He did.
He got so waste.

1860
01:58:03,908 --> 01:58:05,116
Who's your daddy
now, huh?

1861
01:58:05,158 --> 01:58:06,282
He got all these...

1862
01:58:06,741 --> 01:58:08,573
Well, the safe place
is right under it.

1863
01:58:08,865 --> 01:58:11,198
Run it.
Run for his feet!

1864
01:58:19,655 --> 01:58:23,072
You're never eating me.
I'm gonna bust your face up.

1865
01:58:31,696 --> 01:58:34,069
Nobody's tested me.
In your face!

1866
01:58:35,237 --> 01:58:36,404
Take five, Mudflap.

1867
01:58:37,695 --> 01:58:38,653
Oh my God!

1868
01:58:41,986 --> 01:58:43,819
Yeehaw!

1869
01:58:45,569 --> 01:58:47,402
Nobody messes
with the twins.

1870
01:58:50,443 --> 01:58:51,444
I got you.

1871
01:58:55,026 --> 01:58:57,358
Ow, man,
you shot me in the face!

1872
01:58:57,817 --> 01:59:00,066
- Stay under it!
- Yeah, stay under it.

1873
01:59:09,899 --> 01:59:11,732
Rampage, set up the trap.

1874
01:59:21,479 --> 01:59:21,938
Judy!

1875
01:59:27,688 --> 01:59:29,312
- Sam!
- What?

1876
01:59:29,312 --> 01:59:30,104
Sam!

1877
01:59:30,854 --> 01:59:32,438
Sam! Sam!

1878
01:59:37,146 --> 01:59:38,145
Sam!

1879
01:59:38,644 --> 01:59:39,562
- Sam.
- Dad!

1880
01:59:47,602 --> 01:59:49,144
Wait! Wait!

1881
01:59:50,476 --> 01:59:51,226
Please listen--

1882
01:59:52,393 --> 01:59:54,017
I want you to run!
Run!

1883
01:59:54,058 --> 01:59:55,017
- Dad, just stop!
- Get out of here.

1884
01:59:55,058 --> 01:59:56,350
- They don't want you, they want me.
- Just run!

1885
01:59:56,601 --> 01:59:58,017
Oh God, wait!

1886
01:59:58,100 --> 02:00:00,850
- Samuel Witwicky.
- Wait.

1887
02:00:02,849 --> 02:00:04,141
This is what you want.
You don't want 'em.

1888
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,600
- Go! Go!
- Please, stop! Stop!

1889
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:08,557
- Why don't you--
- Just get out of here!

1890
02:00:09,681 --> 02:00:10,557
Just don't move.

1891
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:11,765
I know you.

1892
02:00:12,016 --> 02:00:13,722
Just go!
Just go!

1893
02:00:13,722 --> 02:00:15,181
And I know what,
you need me.

1894
02:00:16,098 --> 02:00:17,223
Because I know about
the Matrix.

1895
02:00:18,055 --> 02:00:19,681
- Don't do it. Sam, listen to me.
- Please, Dad.

1896
02:00:19,723 --> 02:00:20,680
They're gonna
kill us all anyway.

1897
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:22,138
Hey, hey.
Look.

1898
02:00:22,138 --> 02:00:23,513
This is what you want.
I'm here.

1899
02:00:24,221 --> 02:00:25,431
Bumblebee!

1900
02:00:29,553 --> 02:00:30,304
Help!

1901
02:00:38,303 --> 02:00:40,262
Kill him, Bee.
Kill him.

1902
02:01:19,547 --> 02:01:20,755
Come on,
get in.

1903
02:01:34,919 --> 02:01:36,878
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1904
02:01:40,086 --> 02:01:43,252
Hey! I don't know what's going on,
but we gotta move.

1905
02:01:46,918 --> 02:01:48,626
- Run!
- There's gotta be a way out of here.

1906
02:01:54,002 --> 02:01:55,916
Buckle up, buckle up!
Get in here.

1907
02:01:58,168 --> 02:02:00,333
Bee! Bumblebee!

1908
02:02:01,041 --> 02:02:02,915
You get them
somewhere safe, alright?

1909
02:02:05,374 --> 02:02:06,707
You gotta get in the car.
You can be safe.

1910
02:02:06,749 --> 02:02:08,540
No, listen to my discussion.

1911
02:02:08,582 --> 02:02:09,999
- You're my son, alright?
- I know!

1912
02:02:09,999 --> 02:02:11,914
You're my son!
We'll all go together.

1913
02:02:11,956 --> 02:02:13,373
- Listen.
- We're all going together.

1914
02:02:13,415 --> 02:02:15,497
Dad, stop, okay?
Get in the car.

1915
02:02:15,539 --> 02:02:17,581
He's gonna get you to safety.
You don't, you run.

1916
02:02:17,622 --> 02:02:19,830
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.
You hear what I'm saying?

1917
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:21,705
Okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.

1918
02:02:21,747 --> 02:02:23,204
- No.
- You gotta let me go, Dad.

1919
02:02:23,246 --> 02:02:24,580
You'll have
to let me go.

1920
02:02:25,204 --> 02:02:26,704
- You have to.
- Ron.

1921
02:02:29,245 --> 02:02:31,828
Ron, Ron!
Let him go.

1922
02:02:33,704 --> 02:02:34,869
Just come back!

1923
02:02:35,578 --> 02:02:36,870
- Come on!
- Come on!

1924
02:02:36,870 --> 02:02:38,078
Mikaela, Mikaela!

1925
02:02:38,078 --> 02:02:39,828
- Go with my parents.
- I'm not gonna go with them.

1926
02:02:57,908 --> 02:03:00,658
- We got Jordanians!
- We got help!

1927
02:03:24,779 --> 02:03:25,738
You okay, soldier?

1928
02:03:26,405 --> 02:03:27,779
We're gonna help you,
soldier.

1929
02:03:28,071 --> 02:03:29,862
Let's get being moon
and clear the birds!

1930
02:03:29,903 --> 02:03:31,445
Stay still, stay still.
Don't move.

1931
02:03:32,029 --> 02:03:33,029
You alright, young man?

1932
02:03:33,279 --> 02:03:34,404
- You have a radio?
- Yes.

1933
02:03:35,736 --> 02:03:37,902
Hey kid,
it's been nice knowing you.

1934
02:03:38,111 --> 02:03:39,986
Remember what I did
for my country.

1935
02:03:41,403 --> 02:03:42,902
This is my moment.

1936
02:03:44,110 --> 02:03:45,319
You're crazy!

1937
02:03:47,318 --> 02:03:49,151
ETA to station,
two minutes.

1938
02:03:49,192 --> 02:03:51,068
- Put it on the main screen.
- Sir, yes, sir.

1939
02:03:51,317 --> 02:03:52,359
Predator's air-one.

1940
02:04:02,774 --> 02:04:04,274
Oh shit, it's a trick.

1941
02:04:04,316 --> 02:04:06,774
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

1942
02:04:06,816 --> 02:04:09,648
- Get those boys out of the ground.
- This is 101 in strike packages.

1943
02:04:09,690 --> 02:04:11,314
Fast course river.
Execute lightly.

1944
02:04:31,644 --> 02:04:33,729
- Spotted Sam.
- Hurry, don't slow up!

1945
02:04:34,770 --> 02:04:36,019
Ironhide!

1946
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:38,978
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1947
02:04:39,145 --> 02:04:39,602
Look out!

1948
02:04:42,852 --> 02:04:44,934
Sam, get to the pillars!

1949
02:04:46,185 --> 02:04:46,935
Let's go.

1950
02:04:50,851 --> 02:04:54,309
Oh God, this is it. The pyramids built
right over the machine.

1951
02:04:54,350 --> 02:04:55,807
They turn
that machine on...

1952
02:04:57,516 --> 02:04:58,558
no more Sun.

1953
02:05:01,183 --> 02:05:02,599
Not on my watch.

1954
02:05:02,724 --> 02:05:05,765
Not on my watch.

1955
02:05:16,555 --> 02:05:19,473
<i>- USS Stennis, identify.
- Hey, where the hell are you?</i>

1956
02:05:19,681 --> 02:05:20,513
<i>What, you're on
a weather channel?</i>

1957
02:05:20,555 --> 02:05:22,596
<i>Sports center,
high-dreaming TV or something?</i>

1958
02:05:22,637 --> 02:05:24,304
We get a pretty hundred
satellites up there.

1959
02:05:24,429 --> 02:05:26,804
Where the hell
are all our men?

1960
02:05:27,013 --> 02:05:28,596
Identify yourself.

1961
02:05:28,846 --> 02:05:30,179
What is your name, sailor?

1962
02:05:30,636 --> 02:05:35,804
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis Aircraft Carrier.

1963
02:05:36,927 --> 02:05:38,470
Okay, Captain Wilder,

1964
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:40,969
<i>this is Agent Seymour Simmons,
head of the Sector Seven.</i>

1965
02:05:41,094 --> 02:05:43,469
<i>There is a mother of
all non-biologicals</i>

1966
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:45,301
<i>getting ready
to blow up our Sun.</i>

1967
02:05:45,593 --> 02:05:47,177
You want to have fooled down
about my lack of clearance,

1968
02:05:47,218 --> 02:05:49,467
or you want to help
save a gazillion lives?

1969
02:05:50,092 --> 02:05:52,467
Alright, Agent Simmons.
I'm listening.

1970
02:05:59,675 --> 02:06:01,008
Five klicks.

1971
02:06:01,341 --> 02:06:02,467
<i>West of the gulf.</i>

1972
02:06:02,467 --> 02:06:05,423
<i>We got ourselves a dalion
remodelling a pyramid.</i>

1973
02:06:05,882 --> 02:06:08,923
I want hopes of prototype weapon
pull a rail gun.

1974
02:06:10,256 --> 02:06:11,548
That's classified.

1975
02:06:11,798 --> 02:06:15,673
Don't talk to me
about classified, alright?

1976
02:06:15,715 --> 02:06:17,422
Now if you've got
a battleship in the gulf

1977
02:06:18,338 --> 02:06:21,255
you tell him to ready
that weapon!

1978
02:06:22,255 --> 02:06:24,670
Contact Destroyer,
USS Kit.

1979
02:06:27,004 --> 02:06:28,754
This way!
Move it!

1980
02:06:30,712 --> 02:06:32,502
What you need is there.

1981
02:06:32,961 --> 02:06:34,670
Let's go! Go!

1982
02:06:38,461 --> 02:06:40,003
Give me your talk.
Come on.

1983
02:06:40,045 --> 02:06:40,668
Epps!

1984
02:06:45,585 --> 02:06:46,877
Right now,
we need air support.

1985
02:06:48,044 --> 02:06:49,334
That ship's in contact.
20 miles--

1986
02:06:49,791 --> 02:06:51,959
Grid on contact.
Proceed 88, Alpha Sierra.

1987
02:06:55,959 --> 02:06:59,042
USS Stenin 0-9-0,
you are approved to drop a 2,000--

1988
02:07:07,207 --> 02:07:08,499
- What you got?
- A detonator, sir.

1989
02:07:08,499 --> 02:07:10,539
They're 600 minutes away and
they're heading right for the pillars.

1990
02:07:10,581 --> 02:07:11,247
Alright.

1991
02:07:11,998 --> 02:07:13,372
Precious cargo's coming.

1992
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:14,456
Move!

1993
02:07:41,076 --> 02:07:41,952
Sam!

1994
02:07:42,243 --> 02:07:43,411
Spotted Sam.

1995
02:08:15,573 --> 02:08:16,072
Come on!

1996
02:08:16,114 --> 02:08:18,904
2-2, covering fire.
Two civilians, twelve o'clock.

1997
02:08:27,195 --> 02:08:28,195
Cover for us.

1998
02:08:35,236 --> 02:08:38,235
Okay, air strike.
We'll rescue the civilians.

1999
02:08:57,773 --> 02:08:59,649
Come on. Get up!

2000
02:09:00,065 --> 02:09:00,566
Come on!

2001
02:09:01,857 --> 02:09:02,566
Get in here.

2002
02:09:03,399 --> 02:09:04,565
Oh look
who showed up.

2003
02:09:04,815 --> 02:09:06,898
You better have a good reason
for us to be here.

2004
02:09:06,939 --> 02:09:07,857
Where's Optimus?

2005
02:09:08,065 --> 02:09:09,898
He's right over there,
across the courtyard.

2006
02:09:11,022 --> 02:09:11,898
I got to get to him
right now.

2007
02:09:11,939 --> 02:09:13,356
No, we got
an air strike coming.

2008
02:09:13,356 --> 02:09:14,855
I have to get to him
right now.

2009
02:09:16,939 --> 02:09:18,396
Come here,
b-back.

2010
02:09:28,437 --> 02:09:30,020
Incoming!

2011
02:09:34,019 --> 02:09:36,978
Behold to the only
Jetfire!

2012
02:09:38,143 --> 02:09:41,809
Now let me show you
how we brought them pain in my day.

2013
02:10:01,808 --> 02:10:03,183
Too old
for this crap.

2014
02:10:03,223 --> 02:10:04,266
Keep going.

2015
02:10:04,266 --> 02:10:05,599
15 minutes of fighting.

2016
02:10:25,762 --> 02:10:29,596
I am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.

2017
02:10:30,344 --> 02:10:32,553
<i>25.7 metres
above sea level,</i>

2018
02:10:32,595 --> 02:10:33,761
<i>29.32 north.</i>

2019
02:10:33,761 --> 02:10:35,969
- Field track, 5-2, 0500 o'clock.
- Target acquired.

2020
02:10:36,052 --> 02:10:37,178
Killing track two.

2021
02:10:37,344 --> 02:10:39,177
<i>Lock. Fire.</i>

2022
02:10:54,176 --> 02:10:56,133
Yeah! Yeah!

2023
02:10:56,175 --> 02:10:58,092
<i>B-1, stand on my target.
30 seconds...</i>

2024
02:10:59,882 --> 02:11:02,091
We're gonna make a break
for the beast on my command, okay?

2025
02:11:02,133 --> 02:11:04,007
You guys stick with me,
you understand?

2026
02:11:04,048 --> 02:11:05,298
You stay on my ass.

2027
02:11:06,881 --> 02:11:08,757
Hope these F-16s
got good aim.

2028
02:11:08,757 --> 02:11:09,673
Yeah, why is that?

2029
02:11:10,090 --> 02:11:11,715
I told them
to hit the orange smoke.

2030
02:11:13,547 --> 02:11:14,713
You mean
that orange smoke?

2031
02:11:15,213 --> 02:11:16,964
It wasn't my best toss,
okay?

2032
02:11:18,670 --> 02:11:20,212
- Run!
- Run!

2033
02:11:28,670 --> 02:11:30,212
Incoming!

2034
02:11:33,335 --> 02:11:33,919
Come on.

2035
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:08,956
Die!

2036
02:12:15,955 --> 02:12:17,289
Sam!

2037
02:12:33,369 --> 02:12:35,201
Hold your fire!

2038
02:12:37,411 --> 02:12:38,036
Sam!

2039
02:12:40,118 --> 02:12:42,452
Get out!
Get me an EVAC.

2040
02:12:44,451 --> 02:12:46,617
Can't you do something?

2041
02:13:21,738 --> 02:13:23,778
- Sam! Sam...
- Sam!

2042
02:13:30,486 --> 02:13:32,985
Come on, we got to move.
We got to move! Come on!

2043
02:13:38,111 --> 02:13:39,069
Sammy!

2044
02:13:42,902 --> 02:13:46,358
Clear! Take a shot.
Clear! Take a shot.

2045
02:13:46,442 --> 02:13:47,608
One, two, three.

2046
02:13:50,734 --> 02:13:51,359
Do it again.

2047
02:13:57,190 --> 02:13:59,025
Sam!

2048
02:14:00,857 --> 02:14:06,024
Okay, listen to my voice.
I love you and I need you.

2049
02:14:06,856 --> 02:14:12,188
Please, please come back to me.
Sam, please! I love you!

2050
02:14:23,978 --> 02:14:25,812
Am I dead?

2051
02:14:26,603 --> 02:14:30,895
We have been watching you.
A long, long time.

2052
02:14:33,187 --> 02:14:35,227
You have fought
for Optimus,

2053
02:14:35,436 --> 02:14:39,895
our last descendant,
with courage and with sacrifice.

2054
02:14:39,936 --> 02:14:42,560
The virtues of a leader.

2055
02:14:43,018 --> 02:14:46,143
A leader
worthy of our secret.

2056
02:14:46,435 --> 02:14:49,350
The Matrix of Leadership
is not found.

2057
02:14:49,892 --> 02:14:51,309
It is earned.

2058
02:14:52,391 --> 02:14:54,683
Return now to Optimus,

2059
02:14:55,308 --> 02:14:57,557
merge the Matrix
with his Spark.

2060
02:14:58,224 --> 02:15:02,931
It is, and always has been,
your destiny.

2061
02:15:07,723 --> 02:15:08,722
Sam.

2062
02:15:15,096 --> 02:15:16,429
I love you.

2063
02:15:55,299 --> 02:15:58,215
Boy, you returned
for me.

2064
02:15:59,674 --> 02:16:01,673
A living Prime!

2065
02:16:03,215 --> 02:16:05,631
I don't believe it.

2066
02:16:15,838 --> 02:16:18,212
My Matrix.

2067
02:16:23,712 --> 02:16:25,003
Get up, get up,
get up, get up.

2068
02:16:26,211 --> 02:16:27,502
Get up, Prime!

2069
02:16:29,294 --> 02:16:32,795
- Oh, no.
- He's turned on the machine.

2070
02:16:33,586 --> 02:16:35,294
You gotta stop him.
Get up!

2071
02:16:35,626 --> 02:16:37,168
Optimus!

2072
02:16:39,294 --> 02:16:41,751
Fallen, my master.

2073
02:16:41,917 --> 02:16:46,250
My brothers could not
stop me from this.

2074
02:16:47,251 --> 02:16:51,833
- Yes.
- Now I claim your sun.

2075
02:16:54,665 --> 02:16:56,374
Enemy target,
top of pyramid.

2076
02:16:56,374 --> 02:16:58,498
Engage,
engage, engage.

2077
02:17:03,873 --> 02:17:06,789
In moments,
we'll be at siren strength.

2078
02:17:22,619 --> 02:17:27,078
I never did a thing
worth doing until now.

2079
02:17:27,746 --> 02:17:30,536
Optimus,
take my parts.

2080
02:17:30,744 --> 02:17:33,660
And you'll have a power
you've never known.

2081
02:17:34,578 --> 02:17:36,744
Fulfill your destiny.

2082
02:17:42,783 --> 02:17:45,035
Jolt, electrify!

2083
02:18:05,614 --> 02:18:07,281
Let's roll.

2084
02:18:09,738 --> 02:18:11,614
Fire. Take it off
to the pyramid!

2085
02:18:23,653 --> 02:18:27,320
This planet
will be dark forever.

2086
02:18:49,650 --> 02:18:51,900
Die
like your brother.

2087
02:18:52,525 --> 02:18:54,816
They were
your brothers too.

2088
02:19:23,477 --> 02:19:25,770
First gra--

2089
02:19:38,642 --> 02:19:40,727
You picked
the wrong planet!

2090
02:19:43,641 --> 02:19:45,642
Give me your face.

2091
02:19:54,142 --> 02:19:58,266
I rise.
You fall.

2092
02:20:00,348 --> 02:20:03,556
No. No.

2093
02:20:05,056 --> 02:20:09,763
Not to call you a coward, Master,
but sometimes,

2094
02:20:09,763 --> 02:20:13,513
cowards do survive.

2095
02:20:14,055 --> 02:20:15,970
This isn't over.

2096
02:20:43,425 --> 02:20:46,259
You took all of this for you
to tell me that you love me.

2097
02:20:47,967 --> 02:20:49,466
You said it first.

2098
02:21:40,876 --> 02:21:43,291
Thank you, Sam,
for saving my life.

2099
02:21:44,750 --> 02:21:45,333
You're welcome.

2100
02:21:46,792 --> 02:21:48,541
Thank you
for believing in me.

2101
02:21:53,249 --> 02:21:57,915
<i>Our races united by a history
long forgotten.</i>

2102
02:21:57,915 --> 02:22:01,206
<i>And a future
we shall face together.</i>

2103
02:22:01,915 --> 02:22:06,205
<i>I am Optimus Prime,
and I send this message</i>

2104
02:22:06,247 --> 02:22:09,456
<i>so that our past
will always be remembered.</i>

2105
02:22:09,456 --> 02:22:29,536
<i>For in those memories,
we live on.</i>

2106
02:22:30,536 --> 02:22:35,536
