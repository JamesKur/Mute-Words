00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,728
What? Who killed who?
A cop. A lady and a guy.

499
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,064
A cop, a lady and a guy, man?
That's like a massacre.

500
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,192
No, no. No, it was just a guy.
You saw it?

501
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,027
What happened to the lady?
No. No.

502
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:09,865
A woman. A policewoman and a guy,
another guy, shot another guy,

503
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,035
an Asian guy, in the window,
at fucking Ted's house.

504
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,245
Whoa, was the other guy Ted?
I don't know.

505
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,958
He was a big, gray-haired man, and he had a
robe and he fucking took a gun and he shot him.

506
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,044
And his brain fucking flew every--
I'm gonna be-- I'm gonna throw up.

507
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,671
What?

508
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,132
Oh! Sick.
That was chicken fries.

509
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,717
You threw up on my printer.
Ew.

510
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,219
I did.
Did you break it?

511
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,304
I hope not.
Listen, man.

512
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,973
I think the guy was Ted.

513
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,975
And the Asians
are number two in town,

514
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,060
so you saw Ted
capping the competition.

515
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,062
They saw me. They saw me
seeing them shoot the guy.

516
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,897
What? They saw you?

517
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,399
And you fucking came here?

518
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,567
Did they follow you here?
No. No. I don't know.

519
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:49,071
Did they follow you here?
I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

520
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,156
Here's what happened.

521
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:52,866
I saw them kill him.

522
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,744
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

523
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,080
I tossed my roach.

524
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,708
I crashed into two cars.
Yeah.

525
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,003
So they would've heard-- So they must have
heard-- They know someone was out there.

526
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,296
They know someone saw.
They know "someone."

527
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,091
They don't know
it was you. Right?

528
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,218
I don't-- I mean, yeah.

529
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:12,678
I don't know.
Yes.

It's, like, the rarest.

It's almost a shame to smoke it.

it to? The other guys got Snicklefritz?

Here's the question.

599
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,612
Let's say he actually
found the roach.

600
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,991
How could he connect the
Pineapple Express weed to you?

And we're, like,
mad fucking tight, man.

00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,465
One time, he got this girl

607
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:40,052
to give me a hand job, like,
within five minutes of meeting her.

608

It was like, "I don't even
know your name, whoa."

00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:50,145
That is pretty rad, but, like,
let's say Ted calls him and is like,

610
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,439
"Hey, did you sell the
Pineapple Express to anyone?"

611
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,234
He'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul."
Because why wouldn't he, you know?

00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,111
No. Oh, no. Fuck that, man.

if I got you a hand job.

apply to Red. He's a drug dealer.

saying you don't trust me?

I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.

Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.

1476
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:36,970
Okay, good.
I came up with a plan.

1477
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,305
Okay, it might sound weird
at first, but just listen.

1478
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:42,141
Dale. You know what? Drug
dealers-- Let me just tell you something.

1479
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:47,438
Drug dealers are trying to kill me.
And you. And my family.

1480
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:50,483
I can't believe I'm in this situation
right now because of you,

1481
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,236
and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot believe I'm here.

1482
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,238
I can't be addicted
to marijuana.

1483
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,575
A, I use a bong. It filters out
the addictive shit. Seriously.

1484
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,619
B, what the fuck does that have to do
with anything? I witnessed a murder, Angie.

1485
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:03,079
And now I'm dealing with it.

1486
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:05,748
This, that's happening
between us, this is normal.

1487
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:09,002
This happens to every couple who's been dating for
three months. And we just have to work through it.

1488
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,713
No, it doesn't, Dale.
This doesn't happen to anyone.

Congratulations. Had to happen
sometime, right? Why not now?

What the fuck
does that mean?

1494
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:26,352
It means that you are gonna go
to college next year.

You'll get into Godspeed You!
Black Emperor and the fucking Shins.

Clark County doing shit-all.

1498

You're gonna dump me.
So, fuck it, have a good time.

Fuck you, Dale!

You never did like me
anyway, did you?

1501
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,037
You didn't even wanna
meet my parents.

1502
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:48,207
I always cared about you. That's not what this
is, ever. Okay? I always care about you, Angie.

1503

Why don't you ever
act like it, huh?

1504

Why do you never act
like you care about anything?

1505

What do you want--? Okay. Jesus.

Bid Whist? You pimp.

No, I'll give you more,
but you cannot gamble with it.

I know, I'm sorry
about the clocks.

or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.

Hey, you all right, man?
That sounded pretty hectic.

the fuck out of here, okay?

smoking marijuana.

I started selling pot

1534
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,043
is so I could put my bubbe

I gave you my jacket.

You were cold
and I clothed you.

1555

How about in the park when I
said that you were my friend?

1556
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,345
You didn't say anything back.

1557
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:09,056
Well, that's easy.
It's because we're not friends.

That's it.

1561

If you didn't sell those drugs,
I would have no idea who you were,

Just hearing it sounded mean.
